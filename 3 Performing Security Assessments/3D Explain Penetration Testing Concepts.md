EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED

1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing

Penetration testing is a type of assessment that adopts known tactics and techniques to attempt intrusions. Devising, planning, and leading penetration tests is a specialized security role, but at a junior level you are likely to participate in this type of engagement, so you should be able to explain the fundamental principles.
