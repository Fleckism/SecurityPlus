## Information Security
Information security (or infosec) refers to the protection of data resources from unauthorized access, attack, theft, or damage. Data may be vulnerable because of the way it is stored, the way it is transferred, or the way it is processed. The systems used to store, transmit, and process data must demonstrate the properties of security. Secure information has three properties, often referred to as the **CIA Triad**: 

-   ==Confidentiality== means that certain information should only be known to certain people. 
-   ==Integrity== means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources. 
-   ==Availability== means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. 

The triad can also be referred to as "AIC" to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.  

Some security models and researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit. The most important of these is non-repudiation. 

- ==Non-repudiation== means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. For example, a legal document, such as a will, must usually be witnessed when it is signed. If there is a dispute about whether the document was correctly executed, the witness can provide evidence that it was.

## CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK

Within the goal of ensuring information security, cybersecurity refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software. Information security and cybersecurity tasks can be classified as **five functions**, following the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ([nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions)):

-   ==Identify==—develop security policies and capabilities. Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
-   ==Protect==—procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operations life cycle.
-   ==Detect==—perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
-   ==Respond==—identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.
-   ==Recover==—implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.
