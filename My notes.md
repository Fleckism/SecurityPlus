## IoA/C
#IoA_C : Definition
IoA:  Indicator of an attack that is currently happening.
IoC:  are “pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.” Indicators of compromise aid information security and IT professionals in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for indicators of compromise, organizations can detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages.
				
				There are several indicators of compromise that organizations should monitor. In an [article for DarkReading](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/top-15-indicators-of-compromise/d/d-id/1140647?), Ericka Chickowski highlights 15 key indicators of compromise:

-   Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
-   Anomalies in Privileged User Account Activity
-   Geographical Irregularities
-   Log-In Red Flags
-   Increases in Database Read Volume
-   HTML Response Sizes
-   Large Numbers of Requests for the Same File
-   Mismatched Port-Application Traffic
-   Suspicious Registry or System File Changes
-   Unusual DNS Requests
-   Unexpected Patching of Systems
-   Mobile Device Profile Changes
-   Bundles of Data in the Wrong Place
-   Web Traffic with Unhuman Behavior
-   Signs of DDoS Activity

## threat
#threat : a **threat** is a potential negative action or event facilitated by a [vulnerability] that results in an unwanted impact to a computer system or application.

## vulnerability
#vulnerability : is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor

## implement
#implementations:  Put a decision or plan into effect

# 6 skills learned with security+
	1. Network security
		1. Firewall
		2. Intrusion prevention system (IPS)
		3. Advanced threat protection (ATP)
		4. Network access control (NAC)
	2. Risk management
	3. Threats
	4. Data & host security
	5. Identity management
	6. Cryptography and PKI

# Read Carefully!
- When you see a color black, white, red, blue!
	- Look to see if it is referencing a team, hat, or box!!!
	- Don't jump to conclusions and be fooled!

# What is?
- client/server model
- a primary control
- a compensating control
- high latency
- TCP handshake
- UDP 
- Do the ports match up to there protocols
- anomalous
- supports many other data transfer protocols, including FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, SMB, and SMTP 
- frame data
- TCP and UDP are used to investigate network traffic


This is confusing?
**Bypass security controls**—look for easy ways to attack the system. For example, if the network is strongly protected by a firewall, is it possible to gain physical access to a computer in the building and run malware from a USB stick?
