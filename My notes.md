## Information Security
Information security (or infosec) refers to the protection of data resources from unauthorized access, attack, theft, or damage. Data may be vulnerable because of the way it is stored, the way it is transferred, or the way it is processed. The systems used to store, transmit, and process data must demonstrate the properties of security. Secure information has three properties, often referred to as the **CIA Triad**: 

-   ==Confidentiality== means that certain information should only be known to certain people. 
-   ==Integrity== means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources. 
-   ==Availability== means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. 

The triad can also be referred to as "AIC" to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.  

Some security models and researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit. The most important of these is non-repudiation. 

- ==Non-repudiation== means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. For example, a legal document, such as a will, must usually be witnessed when it is signed. If there is a dispute about whether the document was correctly executed, the witness can provide evidence that it was.

## CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK

Within the goal of ensuring information security, cybersecurity refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software. Information security and cybersecurity tasks can be classified as **five functions**, following the framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ([nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions)):

-   ==Identify==—develop security policies and capabilities. Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
-   ==Protect==—procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operations life cycle.
-   ==Detect==—perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
-   ==Respond==—identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.
-   ==Recover==—implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.

## SECURITY CONTROL CATEGORIES

Information and cybersecurity assurance is usually considered to take place within an overall process of business risk management. Implementation of cybersecurity functions is often the responsibility of the IT department. There are many different ways of thinking about how IT services should be governed to fulfill overall business needs. Some organizations have developed IT service frameworks to provide best practice guides to implementing IT and cybersecurity. These frameworks can shape company policies and provide checklists of procedures, activities, and technologies that should ideally be in place. Collectively, these procedures, activities, and tools can be referred to as security controls.

A security control is something designed to give a system or data asset the properties of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation. Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented:

-   ==Technical==—the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.  
	-   Operate without much intervention once configured
-   ==Operational==—the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls.	
	-   Day-to-day administration of security system
	-   Tactical reporting and insights
	-   Controls that require people to implement or administer
	-   Standard operating procedures
-   ==Managerial==—the control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.
	- Oversight of the security system
	-   Strategic reporting and insights
	-   Risk assessment
	-   Security policies

## SECURITY CONTROL FUNCTIONAL TYPES

Security controls can also be classified in types according to the goal or function they perform:

-   ==Preventive==—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventative control operates before an attack can take place. Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects are preventative-type controls. Anti-malware software also acts as a preventative control, by blocking processes identified as malicious from executing. Directives and standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be thought of as administrative versions of preventative controls.
	-   Reduce likelihood of attack
	-   Operate before/preceding an attack
	-   Examples include firewalls, anti-virus, encryption, ...
-   ==Detective==—the control may not prevent or deter access, but it will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion. A detective control operates during the progress of an attack. Logs provide one of the best examples of detective-type controls.
	-   Identify or log signs of attack
	-   Operate during an attack
	-   Examples include intrusion detection, log review, physical inspections, ...
-   ==Corrective==—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event. A corrective control is used after an attack. A good example is a backup system that can restore data that was damaged during an intrusion. Another example is a patch management system that acts to eliminate the vulnerability exploited during the attack.
	-   Reduce or eliminate impact of attack
	-   Operate after/following an attack
	-   Examples include backup, patch management, lessons learned, ...

While most controls can be classed functionally as preventative, detective, or corrective, a few other types can be used to define other cases:

-   ==Physical==—controls such as alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, security cameras, and guards that deter and detect access to premises and hardware are often classed separately.
-   ==Deterrent==—the control may not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion. This could include signs and warnings of legal penalties against trespass or intrusion.
-   ==Compensating==—the control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

## ISO AND CLOUD FRAMEWORKS

### International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27K

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has produced a cybersecurity framework in conjunction with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The framework was established in 2005 and revised in 2013. Unlike the NIST framework, the ISO 27001 Information Security Management standard must be purchased ([iso.org/standard/54534.html](https://iso.org/standard/54534.html)). ISO 27001 is part of an overall 27000 series of information security standards, also known as 27K. Of these, 27002 classifies security controls, 27017 and 27018 reference cloud security, and 27701 focuses on personal data and privacy.

### ISO 31K

Where ISO 27K is a cybersecurity framework, ISO 31K ([iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html)) is an overall framework for enterprise risk management (ERM). ERM considers risks and opportunities beyond cybersecurity by including financial, customer service, competition, and legal liability factors. ISO 31K establishes best practices for performing risk assessments.

### Cloud Security Alliance

The not-for-profit organization Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) produces various resources to assist cloud service providers (CSP) in setting up and delivering secure cloud platforms. These resources can also be useful for cloud consumers in evaluating and selecting cloud services.

-   Security Guidance ([cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance))—a best practice summary analyzing the unique challenges of cloud environments and how on-premises controls can be adapted to them.
-   Enterprise reference architecture ([ea.cloudsecurityalliance.org](https://ea.cloudsecurityalliance.org/))—best practice methodology and tools for CSPs to use in architecting cloud solutions. The solutions are divided across a number of domains, such as risk management and infrastructure, application, and presentation services.
-   Cloud controls matrix ([cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-controls-matrix/))—lists specific controls and assessment guidelines that should be implemented by CSPs. For cloud consumers, the matrix acts as a starting point for cloud contracts and agreements as it provides a baseline level of security competency that the CSP should meet.

### Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) Service Organization Control (SOC)

The Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) are audit specifications developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). These audits are designed to assure consumers that service providers—notably cloud providers, but including any type of hosted or third-party service—meet professional standards ([aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html)). Within SSAE No. 18 (the current specification), there are several levels of reporting:

-   Service Organization Control (SOC2)—evaluates the internal controls implemented by the service provider to ensure compliance with Trust Services Criteria (TSC) when storing and processing customer data. TSC refers to security, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy properties. An SOC2 Type I report assesses the system design, while a Type II report assesses the ongoing effectiveness of the security architecture over a period of 6-12 months. SOC2 reports are highly detailed and designed to be restricted. They should only be shared with the auditor and regulators, and with important partners under non-disclosure agreement (NDA) terms.
-   SOC3—a less detailed report certifying compliance with SOC2. SOC3 reports can be freely distributed.

## BENCHMARKS AND SECURE CONFIGURATION GUIDES

Although a **framework gives a "high-level"**  view of how to plan IT services, it does not generally provide detailed implementation guidance. At a system level, the deployment of servers and applications is covered by benchmarks and secure configuration guides.

### Center for Internet Security (CIS)

The Center for Internet Security ([cisecurity.org](https://cisecurity.org/)) is a not-for-profit organization (founded partly by The SANS Institute). It publishes the well-known "The CIS Critical Security Controls." The CIS-RAM (Risk Assessment Method) can be used to perform an overall evaluation of security posture ([learn.cisecurity.org/cis-ram](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-ram)).

CIS also produces benchmarks for different aspects of cybersecurity. For example, there are benchmarks for compliance with IT frameworks and compliance programs, such as PCI DSS, NIST 800-53, SOX, and ISO 27000. There are also product-focused benchmarks, such as for Windows Desktop, Windows Server, macOS, Linux, Cisco, web browsers, web servers, database and email servers, and VMware ESXi. The CIS-CAT (Configuration Access Tool) can be used with automated vulnerability scanners to test compliance against these benchmarks ([cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-tools/cis-cat-pro/cis-cat-faq](https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-tools/cis-cat-pro/cis-cat-faq/)).

### OS/Network Appliance Platform/Vendor-specific Guides

Operating system (OS) best practice configuration lists the settings and controls that should be applied for a computing platform to work in a defined role, such as client workstation, authentication server, network switch/router/firewall, web/application server, and so on.

Most vendors will provide guides, templates, and tools for configuring and validating the deployment of network appliances, operating systems, web servers, and application/database servers. The security configurations for each of these devices will vary not only by vendor but by device and version as well. The vendor's support portal will host the configuration guides (along with setup/install guides and software downloads and updates) or they can be easily located using a web search engine.

There is also detailed guidance available from several organizations to cover both vendor-neutral deployments and to provide third-party assessment and advice on deploying vendor products. Apart from the CIS controls, some notable sources include:

-   Department of Defense Cyber Exchange provides Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) with hardening guidelines for a variety of software and hardware solutions ([public.cyber.mil](https://public.cyber.mil/)).
-   National Checklist Program (NCP) by NIST provides checklists and benchmarks for a variety of operating systems and applications ([nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository)).

### Application Servers

Most application architectures use a client/server model. This means that part of the application is a client software program, installed and run on separate hardware to the server application code. The client interacts with the server over a network. Attacks can therefore be directed at the local client code, at the server application, or at the network channel between them. As well as coding issues, the applications need to take account of platform issues. The client application might be running in a computing host alongside other, potentially malicious, software. Code that runs on the client should not be trusted. The server-side code should implement routines to verify that input conforms to what is expected.

### Web Server Applications

A web application is a particular type of client/server architecture. A web application leverages existing technologies to simplify development. The application uses a generic client (a web browser), and standard network protocols and servers (HTTP/HTTPS). The specific features of the application are developed using code running on the clients and servers. Web applications are also likely to use a multi-tier architecture, where the server part is split between application logic and data storage and retrieval. Modern web applications may use even more distributed architectures, such as microservices and serverless.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a not-for-profit, online community that publishes several secure application development resources, such as the Top 10 list of the most critical application security risks ([owasp.org/www-project-top-ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)). OWASP has also developed resources, such as the Zed Attack Proxy and Juice Shop (a deliberately unsecure web application), to help investigate and understand penetration testing and application security issues.
