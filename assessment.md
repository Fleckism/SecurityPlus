 **vulnerability assessment, threat hunting, and penetration testing**
 
 Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can use passive or active reconnaissance techniques. A passive approach tries to discover issues without causing an impact to systems, whereas an active approach may cause instability on a scanned system
 
 **Vulnerability scanning by eavesdropping is passive, while penetration testing with credentials is active.**
