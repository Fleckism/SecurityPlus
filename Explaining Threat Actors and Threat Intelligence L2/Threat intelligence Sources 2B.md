 honeynets to try to observe how hackers interact with vulnerable systems.
 
 ## Threat Research Sources
 -  Dark net—a network established as an overlay to Internet infrastructure by software, such as The Onion Router (TOR), Freenet, or I2P, that acts to anonymize usage and prevent a third party from knowing about the existence of the network or analyzing any activity taking place over the network. Onion routing, for instance, uses multiple layers of encryption and relays between nodes to achieve this anonymity.
 -  Dark web—sites, content, and services accessible only over a dark net. While there are dark web search engines, many sites are hidden from them. Access to a dark web site via its URL is often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.
 -  Investigating these dark web sites and message boards is a valuable source of counterintelligence.

## Threat Intelligence Providers
- Threat data can be packaged as feeds that integrate with a security information and event management (SIEM) platform. These feeds are usually described as cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data. The data on its own is not a complete security solution however. To produce actionable intelligence, the threat data must be correlated with observed data from customer networks. This type of analysis is often powered by artificial intelligence (AI) features of the SIEM.
