# EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED

5.3 Explain the importance of policies to organizational security

As well as implementing technical controls for identity and account management, you will need to make sure that your personnel follow appropriate security procedures and policies. The human element can represent a significant attack surface, especially when social engineering attacks are involved. As a security professional, you will work with a human resources (HR) department to assist with the formulation of policies and the development and delivery of security awareness and training programs.
# CONDUCT POLICIES 

Operational policies include privilege/credential management, data handling, and incident response. Other important security policies include those governing employee conduct and respect for privacy.

### Acceptable Use Policy 

Enforcing an acceptable use policy ([[AUP]]) is important to protect the organization from the security and legal implications of employees misusing its equipment. Typically, the policy will forbid the use of equipment to defraud, to defame, or to obtain illegal material. It will prohibit the installation of unauthorized hardware or software and explicitly forbid actual or attempted snooping of confidential data that the employee is not authorized to access. **Acceptable use guidelines must be reasonable and not interfere with employees' fundamental job duties or privacy rights**. An organization's AUP may forbid use of Internet tools outside of work-related duties or restrict such use to break times.

### Code of Conduct and Social Media Analysis 

A code of conduct, or rules of behavior, sets out expected professional standards. For example, employees' use of social media and file sharing poses substantial risks to the organization, **including threat of virus infection or systems intrusion,** lost work time, copyright infringement, and defamation. Users should be aware that any data communications, such as email, made through an organization's computer system are likely stored within the system, on servers, backup devices, and so on. Such communications are also likely to be logged and monitored. Employers may also subject employees' personal social media accounts to analysis and monitoring, to check for policy infringements.

Rules of behavior are also important when considering employees with privileged access to computer systems. Technicians and managers should be bound by clauses that forbid them from misusing privileges to snoop on other employees or to disable a security mechanism.

### Use of Personally Owned Devices in the Workplace

Portable devices, such as smartphones, USB sticks, media players, and so on, pose a considerable threat to data security, as they make file copy so easy. Camera and voice recording functions are other obvious security issues. Network access control, endpoint management, and data loss prevention solutions can be of some use in preventing the attachment of such devices to corporate networks. Some companies may try to prevent staff from bringing such devices on site. This is quite difficult to enforce, though.

Also important to consider is the unauthorized use of personal software by employees or employees using software or services that has not been sanctioned for a project ([[shadow IT]]). Personal software may include either locally installed software or hosted applications, such as personal email or instant messenger, and may leave the organization open to a variety of security vulnerabilities. **Such programs may provide a route for data exfiltration, a transport mechanism for malware, or possibly software license violations** for which the company might be held liable, just to name a few of the potential problems.

### Clean Desk Policy 

A clean desk policy means that each employee's work area should be free from any documents left there. The aim of the policy is to prevent sensitive information from being obtained by unauthorized staff or guests at the workplace.
# USER AND ROLE-BASED TRAINING

Another essential component of a secure system is **effective user training**. Untrained users represent a serious vulnerability because they are susceptible to social engineering and malware attacks and may be careless when handling sensitive or confidential data.

Appropriate security awareness training needs to be delivered to employees at all levels, including end users, technical staff, and executives. Some of the general topics that need to be covered include the following:

-   Overview of the organization's security policies and the penalties for non-compliance.
-   Incident identification and reporting procedures.
-   Site security procedures, restrictions, and advice, including safety drills, escorting guests, use of secure areas, and use of personal devices.
-   Data handling, including document confidentiality, [[PII]], backup, encryption, and so on.
-   Password and account management plus security features of PCs and mobile devices.
-   Awareness of social engineering and malware threats, including phishing, website exploits, and spam plus alerting methods for new threats.
-   Secure use of software such as browsers and email clients plus appropriate use of Internet access, including social networking sites.

There should also be a system for identifying staff performing security-sensitive roles and grading the level of training and education required (between beginner, intermediate, and advanced, for instance). Note that in defining such training programs you need to focus on job roles, rather than job titles, as employees may perform different roles and have different security training, education, or awareness requirements in each role.

The NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework ([nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice)) sets out knowledge, skills, and abilities ([[KSAAs]])  for different cybersecurity roles. Security awareness programs are described in SP800-50 ([nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/nistspecialpublication800-50.pdf)).
# DIVERSITY OF TRAINING TECHNIQUES

It is necessary to frame security training in language that end users will respond to. Education should focus on responsibilities and threats that are relevant to users. It is necessary to educate users about new or emerging threats (such as fileless malware, phishing scams, or zero-day exploits in software), but this needs to be stated in language that users understand.

Using a diversity of training techniques helps to improve engagement and retention. Training methods include facilitated workshops and events, one-on-one instruction and mentoring, plus resources such as computer-based or online training, videos, books, and blogs/newsletters.

### Phishing Campaigns

A phishing campaign training event means sending simulated phishing messages to users. Users that respond to the messages can be targeted for follow-up training.

### Capture the Flag

Capture the Flag ([[CTF]]) is usually used in ethical hacker training programs and gamified competitions. Participants must complete a series of challenges within a virtualized computing environment to discover a flag. The flag will represent either [[[[threat actor]]]] activity (for blue team exercises) or a vulnerability (for red team exercises) and the participant must use analysis and appropriate tools to discover it. Capturing the flag allows the user to progress to the next level and start a new challenge. Once the participant has passed the introductory levels, they will join a team and participate in a competitive event, where there are multiple flags embedded in the environment and capturing them wins points for the participant and for their team.

### Computer-Based Training and Gamification

Participants respond well to the competitive challenge of CTF events. This type of gamification can be used to boost security awareness for other roles too. Computer-based training (CBT) allows a student to acquire skills and experience by completing various types of practical activities:

-   **Simulations**—recreating system interfaces or using emulators so students can practice configuration tasks.
-   **Branching scenarios**—students choose between options to find the best choices to solve a cybersecurity incident or configuration problem.

CBT might use video game elements to improve engagement. For example, students might win badges and level-up bonuses such as skills or digitized loot to improve their in-game avatar. Simulations might be presented so that the student chooses encounters from a map and engages with a simulation environment in a first person shooter type of 3D world.
