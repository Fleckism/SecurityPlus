## Tables[](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables)

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
```
