#Security_Assessment
Does the mind map include this entire note I'm guessing yes
## Security Assessment refers to the process and tools that evaluate the attack surface. With knowledge of adversary tactics and capabilities, you can assess whether points on the attack surface are potentially vulnerable attack vectors.  The output of assessment is recommendations for deploying, enhancing, or reconfiguring security controls to mitigate the risk that vulnerabilities are exploitable by threat actors.

#Attack_surface the process of mapping it out is referred to as network reconnaissance and discovery.

- Topology discovery ( footprinting ) scanning hosts, IP ranges, and routes between networks to map out the structure of the target network.
	- Can also be used to build an asset database and to identify non-authorized hosts(rogue system detection) or network configuration errors
#Command_Line_Tools
	-	ipconfig (win):  Show the configuration assigned to network interface(s) 
	-	ifconfig (linux): "                  "
	-   ping:  probe a host on a particular IP address or host name using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
	-	arp: Display the local machines Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) cache
	
	
	
	
	




## Route and Traceroute
-	route: View and configure the host's local routing table.
