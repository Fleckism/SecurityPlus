## EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED

1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of vulnerabilities

Performing a security assessment effectively is not simply a matter of choosing appropriate tools. You need to understand the types of vulnerabilities that affect information systems and networks. You must also be able to evaluate and explain the impacts that can arise from vulnerabilities, so that assessment and remediation activities can be given priority where they are most needed.

## SOFTWARE VULNERABILITIES AND PATCH MANAGEMENT

Software exploitation means an attack that targets a vulnerability in software code. An application vulnerability is a design flaw that can cause the security system to be circumvented or that will cause the application to crash. Typically, vulnerabilities can only be exploited in quite specific circumstances but because of the complexity of modern software and the speed with which new versions must be released to market, almost no software is free from vulnerabilities. As two contrasting examples, consider vulnerabilities affecting Adobe's PDF document reader versus a vulnerability in the server software underpinning transport security. The former could give a threat actors a foothold on a corporate network via a workstation; the latter could expose the cryptographic keys used to provide secure web services to compromise. Both are potentially high impact for different reasons.

It is also important to realize that software vulnerabilities affect all types of code, not just applications:

-   Operating system (OS)—an application exploit will run with the permissions of the logged on user, which will hopefully be limited. A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library is more likely to allow privilege escalation, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Dirty COW is one example of a Linux kernel vulnerability ([access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141)).
-   Firmware—vulnerabilities can exist in the BIOS/UEFI firmware that controls the boot process for PCs. There can also be bugs in device firmware, such as network cards and disk controllers. Finally, network appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices run OS code as a type of firmware. Like kernel vulnerabilities, firmware exploits can be difficult to identify, because the exploit code can run with the highest level of privilege. The Intel AMT vulnerability illustrates the impacts of a firmware vulnerability ([blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf)).

Most vulnerabilities are discovered by software and security researchers, who notify the vendor to give them time to patch the vulnerability before releasing details to the wider public. Improper or weak patch management is an additional layer of vulnerability where these security patches are not applied to systems, leaving them vulnerable to exploits. Poor configuration management may mean that the organization is simply not documenting and managing its assets rigorously. Patches may be deployed to some systems, but not others. Patches may be applied and then removed because they cause performance issues.
## ZERO-DAY AND LEGACY PLATFORM VULNERABILITIES

Even if effective patch management procedures are in place, attackers may still be able to use software vulnerabilities as an attack vector. A vulnerability that is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch is called a zero-day. These can be extremely destructive, as it can take the vendor some time to develop a patch, leaving systems vulnerable in the interim.

The term zero-day is usually applied to the vulnerability itself but can also refer to an attack or malware that exploits it. The EternalBlue zero-day exploit makes for an instructive case study ([wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world](https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/)).

Zero-day vulnerabilities have significant financial value. A zero-day exploit for a mobile OS can be worth millions of dollars. Consequently, an adversary will only use a zero-day vulnerability for high value attacks. State security and law enforcement agencies are known to stockpile zero-days to facilitate the investigation of crimes.

A legacy platform is one that is no longer supported with security patches by its developer or vendor. This could be a PC/laptop/smartphone, networking appliance, peripheral device, Internet of Things device, operating system, database/programming environment, or software application. By definition, legacy platforms are unpatchable. Such systems are highly likely to be vulnerable to exploits and must be protected by security controls other than patching, such as isolating them to networks that an attacker cannot physically connect to.
## WEAK HOST CONFIGURATIONS

While ineffective patch and configuration management policies and procedures represent one type of vulnerability, weak configurations can have similar impacts.

### Default Settings

Relying on the manufacturer default settings when deploying an appliance or software applications is one example of weak configuration. It is not sufficient to rely on the vendor to ship products in a default-secure configuration, though many now do. Default settings may leave unsecure interfaces enabled that allow an attacker to compromise the device. Network appliances with weak settings can allow attackers to move through the network unhindered and snoop on traffic.

### Unsecured Root Accounts 

The root account, referred to as the default Administrator account in Windows or generically as the superuser, has no restrictions set over system access. A superuser account is used to install the OS. An unsecured root account is one that an adversary is able to gain control of, either by guessing a weak password or by using some local boot attack to set or change the password. Software bugs can also allow root access, such as one affecting MacOS ([arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/macos-bug-lets-you-log-in-as-admin-with-no-password-required](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/macos-bug-lets-you-log-in-as-admin-with-no-password-required/)). These vulnerabilities are extremely serious as they give the threat actor complete control of the system.

Effective user management and authorization policies should be enforced so that the superuser account is highly restricted and administration tasks are performed by least privilege management accounts or roles instead. The default root or Administrator account is usually disabled for login. Even if this type of account is enabled for local (interactive) login, it should not be accessible via remote login mechanisms.

### Open Permissions

Open permissions refers to provisioning data files or applications without differentiating access rights for user groups. Permissions systems can be complex and it is easy to make mistakes, such as permitting unauthenticated guests to view confidential data files, or allowing write access when only read access is appropriate. This issue is particularly prevalent on cloud storage, where administrators used to Windows and Linux directory access control lists may be unfamiliar with the cloud equivalents ([directdefense.com/how-to-prevent-exploitation-of-amazon-s3-buckets-with-weak-permissions](https://www.directdefense.com/how-to-prevent-exploitation-of-amazon-s3-buckets-with-weak-permissions/)).
## WEAK NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS

Vulnerabilities can also arise from running unnecessary services or using weak encryption.

### Open Ports and Services

Network applications and services allow client connections via Transport Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port numbers. The clients and servers are identified by Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Servers must operate with at least some open ports, but security best practice dictates that these should be restricted to only necessary services. Running unnecessary open ports and services increases the attack surface. Some generic steps to harden services to meet a given role include:

-   If the service is security-critical (such as a remote administration interface), restrict endpoints that are allowed to access the service by IP address or address range. Alternatively, prevent suspect endpoints from connecting by adding them to the block list, but otherwise allow access.
-   Disable services that are installed by default but that are not needed. Ideally, disable the service on the server itself, but in some circumstances it may be necessary to block the port using a firewall instead.
-   For services that should only be available on the private network, block access to ports at border firewalls or segment the network so that the servers cannot be accessed from external networks.

### Unsecure Protocols

An unsecure protocol is one that transfers data as cleartext; that is, the protocol does not use encryption for data protection. Lack of encryption also means that there is no secure way to authenticate the endpoints. This allows an attacker to intercept and modify communications, acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM).

### Weak Encryption

Encryption algorithms protect data when it is stored on disk or transferred over a network. Encrypted data should only be accessible to someone with the correct decryption key. Weak encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data. Such vulnerabilities arise in the following circumstances:

-   The key is generated from a simple password, making it vulnerable to guessing attempts by brute-force enumeration (if the password is too short) or dictionary enumeration (if the password is not complex).
-   The algorithm or cipher used for encryption has known weaknesses that allow brute-force enumeration.
-   The key is not distributed securely and can easily fall into the hands of people who are not authorized to decrypt the data.

### Errors

Weakly configured applications may display unformatted error messages under certain conditions. These error messages can be revealing to threat actors probing for vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. Secure coding practices should ensure that if an application fails, it does so "gracefully" without revealing information that could assist the development of an exploit.

## IMPACTS FROM VULNERABILITIES

Vulnerabilities can lead to various data breach and data loss scenarios. These events can have serious impacts in terms of costs and damage to the organization's reputation.

### Data Breaches and Data Exfiltration Impacts

All information should be collected, stored, and processed by authenticated users and hosts subject to the permissions (authorization) allocated to them by the data owner. Data breach and data exfiltration describe two types of event where unauthorized information use occurs:

-   A _data breach event_ is where confidential data is read, transferred, modified, or deleted without authorization. A privacy breach is where personal data is not collected, stored, or processed in full compliance with the laws or regulations governing personal information. A breach can also be described as a data leak. A data breach can be intentional/malicious or unintentional/accidental.
-   _Data exfiltration_ is the methods and tools by which an attacker transfers data without authorization from the victim's systems to an external network or media. Unlike a data breach, a data exfiltration event is always intentional and malicious. A data breach is a consequence of a data exfiltration event.

Data breach includes a wide range of scenarios with different levels of impact. The most severe data breaches compromise valuable intellectual property (IP) or the personal information of account holders.

### Identity Theft Impacts

A privacy breach may allow the threat actor to perform identity theft or to sell the data to other malicious actors. The threat actor may obtain account credentials or might be able to use personal details and financial information to make fraudulent credit applications and purchases.

### Data Loss and Availability Loss Impacts

Compared to data breaches, data loss is where information becomes unavailable, either permanently or temporarily. Availability is sometimes overlooked as a security attribute compared to confidentiality and integrity, but it can have severe impacts on business workflows. If processing systems are brought down by accidental or malicious disaster events, a company may not be able to perform crucial workflows like order processing and fulfillment. 

Some definitions of data breach focus on the unauthorized release of information, while others include loss of information, such as encryption of a database by ransomware. The events that constitute a data breach are often specified in legislation or regulations, which will also impose requirements to notify stakeholders.

### Financial and Reputation Impacts

All these impacts can have direct financial impacts due to damages, fines, and loss of business. Data/privacy breach and availability loss events will also cause a company's reputation to drop with direct customers. Major events might cause widespread adverse publicity on social media and mainstream media. In anticipation of these impacts, incident handling teams should include public relations (PR) and marketing expertise to minimize reputational damage.
