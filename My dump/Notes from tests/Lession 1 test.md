A technical control is enforced by computer hardware and software, such as an access control list (ACL) configured on a network firewall.

Monitoring of risk and compliance is a type of managerial control, not an operational control. Operational controls are categorized as those performed by people, such as security guards.

A preventive control such as user education and training is one that eliminates or reduces the likelihood of an attack before it can take place.

A corrective control such as backup is used following an attack to eliminate or mitigate its impact.
