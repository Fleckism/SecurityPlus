A system administrator has just entered their credentials to enter a secure server room. As the administrator is entering the door, someone is walking up to the door with their hands full of equipment and appears to be struggling to move items around while searching for their credentials. The system administrator quickly begins to assist by getting items out of the person's hands, and they walk into the room together. This person is not an employee, but someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the server room. What type of social engineering has occurred?

2.  Consensus/social proof

Solution

Consensus/social proof revolves around the belief that without an explicit instruction to behave in a certain way, people will follow social norms. It is typically polite to assist someone with their hands full.

Familiarity/Liking is when an attacker uses charisma to persuade others to do as requested. They downplay their requests to make it seem like their request is not out of the ordinary.

Authority and Intimidation can be used by an attacker by pretending to be someone senior. The person receiving the request would feel the need to take action quickly and without questioning the attacker.

Identity fraud is a specific type of impersonation where the attacker uses specific details (such as personal information) of someone's identity.

An employee is having coffee at an outdoor coffee shop and is not taking precautions against someone watching their screen while working on a company project. A person a few tables over watches the employee enter their credentials and then takes photos of the work they are completing with their smartphone.  Which form of social engineering is being used in this situation?


3.  Shoulder surfing


Solution

Shoulder surfing is stealing a password by watching the user type it. Although the attacker was not looking over the employee’s shoulder, the login credentials were obtained through observation.

Vishing is a phishing attack conducted through a voice channel. With no clue about the nature of the call received by the employee, it cannot be assumed to be part of an attack and would not be the best answer.

While a lunchtime attack involves leaving a workstation unattended, it does not involve obtaining a password. Rather, physical access to the system is gained through a logged-in computer.

A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker sits between two communicating hosts to intercept information. It is not social engineering.

Which of the following depict ways a malicious attacker can gain access to a target's network? **(Select all that apply.)**


2.  Phishing
3.  Shoulder surfing


Solution

Phishing and shoulder surfing are social engineering attacks. Phishing occurs when an attacker sends a legitimate-looking, spoofed email to a user of the spoofed site to trick the user into revealing private information.

Shoulder surfing is used to obtain someone’s password or PIN by observing a user typing it on the keyboard. Social engineering is malicious behavior meant to get users to reveal confidential information.

Ethical hacking is trying to identify weaknesses in a network. It is done with permission and is not malicious in intent.

An influence campaign is a program launched by an adversary with a high level of capability. The goal of an influence campaign is to shift public opinion on some topic.

Analyze the following attacks to determine which best illustrates a pharming attack.


4.  A customer enters the correct URL address of their bank, which should point to the IP address 172.1.24.4. However, the browser goes to 168.254.1.1, which is a fake site designed to look exactly like the real bank site.

Solution

Pharming is a means of redirecting users from a legitimate website to a malicious one that relies on corrupting the way the victim's computer performs IP address resolution. This is illustrated in the bank customer scenario.

Phishing is a type of email-based social engineering attack, in which the attacker sends email from a supposedly reputable source to try to elicit private information from the victim. This is exhibited in the insurance customer scenario.

Vishing is a phishing attack conducted through a voice channel. This is seen in the IT department scenario.

A watering hole attack relies on the circumstance that a group of targets may use an unsecure third-party website. This is shown in the sales department scenario.
# 5
An individual receives a text message that appears to be a warning from a well-known order fulfillment company, informing them that the carrier has tried to deliver his package twice, and that if the individual does not contact them to claim it, the package will not be delivered. Analyze the scenario and select the social engineering technique being used.

1.  SMiShing

Solution

SMiShing attempts use short message service (SMS) text communications as the vector.

Phishing is a combination of social engineering and spoofing. It persuades or tricks the target into interacting with a malicious resource disguised as a trusted one, traditionally using email as the vector.

Vishing is a phishing attack conducted through a voice channel, such as telephone or VoIP. Vishing attempts may succeed when a target finds it more difficult to refuse a request made in a phone call compared to one made in an email.

Prepending can make a phishing or hoax email more convincing. Used offensively, prepending means adding text that appears to have been generated by the mail system.

# 6
Which situation would require keyboard encryption software be installed on a computer?

4.  To protect against spyware

Solution

Keyboard encryption software is used to protect against keyloggers, which record keystrokes for the purpose of stealing data. Keyloggers are spyware.

Single sign-on is a technology that enables a user to authenticate once and receive authorizations for multiple services. It does not require keyboard encryption.

Input validation involves limiting the type of data a user can enter into specific fields, such as not allowing special characters in a user name field. Encryption is not a concern.

Key management is the process of administering cryptographic keys and is performed by a Certificate Authority. It is not applicable to keyboard encryption.
# 7
A gaming company decides to add software on each title it releases. The company's objective is to require the CD to be inserted during use. This software will gain administrative rights, change system files, and may hide from detection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Consider the malware characteristics and determine which may be used.  (**Select all that apply**)


3.  Rootkit
4.  Trojan

Solution

A rootkit is characterized by its ability to hide itself by changing core system files and programming interfaces and to escalate privileges. The gaming company accomplished this.

Trojans cannot conceal their presence entirely and will surface as a running process or service. While a rootkit is a type of Trojan or spyware, it differs in its ability to hide itself.

Spyware monitors user activity and may be installed with or without the user's knowledge, but it cannot gain administrative privileges or hide itself.

A keylogger is also a type of spyware that records a user’s keystrokes. It occurs without a user’s knowledge, but it cannot hide itself or gain privileges.
# 8
A hacker is able to install a keylogger on a user's computer. What is the hacker attempting to do in this situation?

4.  Steal confidential information

Solution

Keyloggers actively attempt to steal confidential information by recording the keystrokes of a user.

Key management is the process of administering cryptographic keys and managing their usage, storage, expiration, renewal, revocation, recovery, and escrow. It does not describe something that a hacker would install.

Encryption is a way of encoding data into ciphertext, which is unreadable unless it is decoded. Keyloggers are only interested in recording keystrokes, not decrypting data.

Obfuscation is a technique that essentially "hides" or "camouflages" code or other information so that it is harder to read by unauthorized users. Keyloggers do not want to hide anything, they want to steal useful information by capturing keystrokes.
# 9
A user's PC is infected with a virus that appears to be memory resident and loads anytime it is booted from an external universal serial bus (USB) thumb drive. Examine the following options and determine which describes the infection type.


2.  Boot virus

Solution

With a boot virus, code is written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media. The code executes as a memory resident process when the OS starts.

Script and macro viruses use the programming features available in local scripting engines for the OS and/or browser, such as PowerShell.

A computer worm is memory-resident malware that can run without user intervention and replicate over network resources.

Spyware is malware that can perform adware-like tracking, but also monitor local application activity, take screenshots, and activate recording devices.
# 10
An employee calls IT personnel and states that they received an email with a PDF document to review. After the PDF was opened, the system has not been performing correctly. An IT admin conducted a scan and found a virus. Determine the two classes of viruses the computer most likely has. **(Select all that apply.)**

2.  Program
3.  Script

Solution

Both a program and script virus can use a PDF as a vector. The user stated that a PDF file was recently opened. A program virus is executed when an application is executed. Executable objects can also be embedded or attached within other file types such as Microsoft Word and Rich Text Format.

A script virus typically targets vulnerabilities in an interpreter. Scripts are powerful languages used to automate operating system functions and add interactivity to web pages and are executed by an interpreter rather than self-executing. PDF documents have become a popular vector for script viruses.

A boot sector virus is one that attacks the disk boot sector information, the partition table, and sometimes the file system.

A trojan is a type of virus that infiltrates a system and creates a vector for other viruses or attackers to get into the system.
