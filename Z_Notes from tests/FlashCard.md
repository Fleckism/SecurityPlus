## Question:
You have received an urgent threat advisory and need to configure a network vulnerability  scan to check for the presence of a related CVE on your network.  What configuration check should you make in the vulnerability scanning software before running the scan?

## Answer:
Verify that the vulnerability feed/plug-in/test has been updated with the specific CVE that you need to test for.

## Question: 
You have configured a network vulnerability scanner for an engineering company.   When running a scan, multiple sensors within an embedded system network became unresponsive, causing a production shutdown.  What alternative method of vulnerability scanning should be used for the embedded systems network

## Answer:
A fully non-intrusive solution should be adopted, such as sniffing traffic using a network tap or mirror port. Using the network traffic to detect vulnerabilities rather than actively probing each device will not cause system stability issues (though there is greater risk of false positive and false negative results).
## Question:
A vulnerability scan reports that a CVE associated with CentOS Linux is present on a host, but you have established that the host is not running CentOS. What type of scanning error event is this?

## Answer:
False positive

## Question:
A small company that you provide security consulting support to has resisted investing in an event management and threat intelligence platform. The CEO has become concerned about an APT risk known to target supply chains within the company's industry sector and wants you to scan their systems for any sign that they have been targeted already. What are the additional challenges of meeting this request, given the lack of investment?

## Answer:
Collecting network traffic and log data from multiple sources and then analyzing it manually will require many hours of analyst time. The use of threat feeds and intelligence fusion to automate parts of this analysis effort would enable a much swifter response.

## Question:
What term refers to assessment techniques that avoid alerting [[threat actor]]s?

## Answer:
This can be referred to as maneuver.
# Penetration testing assessment 
## Question:
A website owner wants to evaluate whether the site security mitigates risks from criminal syndicates, assuming no risk of insider threat. What type of penetration testing engagement will most closely simulate this adversary capability and resources?
## Answer:
A [[threat actor]] has no privileged information about the website configuration or security controls. This is simulated in a black box (or blind) pen test engagement.

## Question:
You are agreeing a proposal to run a series of team-based exercises to test security controls under different scenarios. You propose using purple team testing, but the contracting company is only familiar with the concept of red and blue teams. What is the advantage of running a purple team exercise?

## Answer:
In a red versus blue team, there is no contact between the teams, and no opportunity to collaborate on improving security controls. In a purple team exercise, there is regular contact and knowledge sharing between the teams throughout the progression of the exercise.

## Question:

Why should an Internet service provider (ISP) be informed before pen testing on a hosted website takes place?

## Answer:

ISPs monitor their networks for suspicious traffic and may block the test attempts. The pen test may also involve equipment owned and operated by the ISP.

## Question:
What tools are used for OSINT?
## Answer:
Open-source intelligence is a reconnaissance activity to gather information about the target from any public source. The basic tool is web searches/queries plus sites that scan/scrape/monitor vulnerabilities in Internet-facing services and devices. There are also specialist OSINT tools, such as theHarvester, that aggregate data from queries of different resources.
## Question:
In the context of penetration testing, what is persistence?
## Answer:
Persistence refers to the tester's ability to reconnect to the compromised host and use it as a remote access tool (RAT) or backdoor.
