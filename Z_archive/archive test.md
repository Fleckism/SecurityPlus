# q1
In which of these situations might a non-credentialed vulnerability scan be more advantageous than a credentialed scan? **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  When active scanning poses no risk to system stability
2.  External assessments of a network perimeter
3.  Detection of security setting misconfiguration
4.  ==Web application scanning==

Solution

Non-credentialed scanning is often the most appropriate technique for external assessment of the network perimeter or when performing web application scanning.

A non-credentialed scan proceeds by directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. A non-credentialed scan provides a view of what the host exposes to an unprivileged user on the network.

A passive scan has the least impact on the network and on hosts but is less likely to identify vulnerabilities comprehensively.

Configuration reviews investigate how system misconfigurations make controls less effective or ineffective, such as antivirus software not being updated, or management passwords left configured to the default. Configuration reviews generally require a credentialed scan

# q2
Which of the following statements summarizes a disadvantage to performing an active vulnerability scan? **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  ==Active scanning consumes more network bandwidth.
2.  ==Active scanning runs the risk of causing an outage.==
3.  Active scanning may fail to identify all of a system’s known vulnerabilities.
4.  Active scanning techniques do not use system login.

Solution

Scan intrusiveness is a measure of how much the scanner interacts with the target. Active scanning consumes more network bandwidth than passive scanning.

Active scanning means probing the device's configuration using some type of network connection with the target. This type of scanning runs the risk of crashing the target of the scan or causing some other sort of outage.

Passive scanning has the least impact on the network and on hosts but is less likely to identify vulnerabilities comprehensively.

A non-credentialed scan proceeds by directing test packets at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. A non-credentialed scan provides a view of what the host exposes to an unprivileged user on the network.

# q3
Encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to protected data. Which component is subject to brute-force enumeration?

1.  An unsecured protocol
2.  A software vulnerability
==3.  A weak cipher==
4.  A lost decryption key

Solution

An unsecured protocol is one that transfers data as cleartext—that is, the protocol does not use encryption for data protection.

Software vulnerabilities affect all types of code. Operating system and firmware vulnerabilities may allow escalated permissions and unauthorized access. Software and security researchers discover most vulnerabilities and release patches to remedy them.

Weak encryption vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data. An algorithm or cipher used for encryption has known weaknesses that allow brute-force enumeration.

If a decryption key is not distributed securely, it can easily fall into the hands of people who are not authorized to decrypt the data.

# q4
Following a data breach at a large retail company, their public relations team issues a statement emphasizing the company’s commitment to consumer privacy. Identify the true statements concerning this event. **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  The data breach must be an intentional act of corporate sabotage.
2.  ==The privacy breach may allow the threat actor to sell the data to other malicious actors.==
3.  ==Data exfiltration by a malicious actor may have caused the data breach==.
4.  The data breach event may compromise data integrity, but not information availability.

Solution

A privacy breach may allow the threat actor to perform identity theft or to sell the data to other malicious actors. Malicious actors may obtain account credentials or use personal details and financial information to make fraudulent credit applications and purchases.

A data breach is a consequence of a data exfiltration event. A data exfiltration event is always intentional and malicious.

A data breach event is where confidential data is read or transferred without authorization. A data breach, unlike data exfiltration, can be intentional/malicious or unintentional/accidental.

Availability means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. If a data breach brings down processing systems, a company may not be able to perform crucial workflows like order processing and fulfillment, compromising information availability.

# q5
Which statement best explains the differences between black box, white box, and gray box attack profiles used in penetration testing?

1.  A black box pen tester acts as a privileged insider and must perform no reconnaissance. A white box pen tester has no access, and reconnaissance is necessary. A gray box actor is a third-party actor who mediates between a black box and white box pen tester.
2.  A black box pen tester acts as the adversary in the test, while the white box pen tester acts in a defensive role. A gray box pen tester is a third-party actor who mediates between a black box pen tester and a white box pen tester.
3.  ==In a black box pen test, the contractor receives no privileged information, so they must perform reconnaissance. In contrast, a white box pen tester has complete access and skips reconnaissance. A gray box tester has some, but not all information, and requires partial reconnaissance.==
4.  In a white box pen test, the contractor receives no privileged information, so they must perform reconnaissance. In contrast, a black box pen tester has complete access and skips reconnaissance. A gray box tester has some, but not all information, and requires partial reconnaissance.

Solution

A black box penetration tester receives no privileged information, while a white box tester has complete access. A white box test may follow up on a black box test.

In a black box pen test, the consultant receives no privileged information about the network and its security systems. A gray box pen tester has partial access and must perform some reconnaissance.

A red team performs an offensive role to try to infiltrate the target. A blue team defends a target system by operating monitoring and alerting controls to detect and prevent the infiltration.

White box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat. Gray box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of an unprivileged insider threat.
