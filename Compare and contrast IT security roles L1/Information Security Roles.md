The **identify function** is to develop security policies and capabilities. This function is used to evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.

The **detect function** is to perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.

The **recover function** is to implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.

The **respond function** is to identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.

- Jr. security analyst

# Information Security (infosec)
## CIA Triad (aka AIC):  Secure information processing system
- Confidentiality: Information should only be know to certain people.
- Integrity:  Means the data is stored and transferred as intended and modifications are only done by authorized users.
- Availability:  Means the information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it.
- Non-repudiation: An act cannot be denied by a person.

# Cybersecurity Framework
-   Identify—develop security policies and capabilities. Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
-   Protect—procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operations life cycle.
-   Detect—perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
-   Respond—identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.
-   Recover—implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.

## Incident Response
- cyber incident response team (CIRT)/
- computer security incident response team (CSIRT)/
- computer emergency response team (CERT)

# Security Control Categories
A security control is something designed to give a system or data asset the properties of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation. Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented:

-   Technical—the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.
-   Operational—the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls.
-   Managerial—the control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.

# Security Control functional types
- Preventive: the control acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack will succeed.  A preventive control operates before an attack can take place.
- Detective:  The control may not prevent or deter access, but it will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion. i.e. logs
- Corrective:  The control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event.  A corrective control is used after an attack. i.e. backup system
- Physical
- Deterrent
- ?Operational enforced by a person

Other types of controls are, Physical, i.e. alarms, gateways, locks, security.  Deterrent(not physical or logically preventive), i.e. signs and warnings of legal penalties

- No idea ? Compensating—the control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.
- Frameworks:  Are non-regulatory but are "best practices".
- ISO and Cloud Frameworks
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27K
- ISO 31k
- Cloud Security Alliance
- ### Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) Service Organization Control (SOC)

The Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) are audit specifications developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). These audits are designed to assure consumers that service providers—notably cloud providers, but including any type of hosted or third-party service—meet professional standards ([aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/serviceorganization-smanagement.html)). Within SSAE No. 18 (the current specification), there are several levels of reporting:

-   Service Organization Control (SOC2)—evaluates the internal controls implemented by the service provider to ensure compliance with Trust Services Criteria (TSC) when storing and processing customer data. TSC refers to security, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy properties. An SOC2 Type I report assesses the system design, while a Type II report assesses the ongoing effectiveness of the security architecture over a period of 6-12 months. SOC2 reports are highly detailed and designed to be restricted. They should only be shared with the auditor and regulators, and with important partners under non-disclosure agreement (NDA) terms.
-   SOC3—a less detailed report certifying compliance with SOC2. SOC3 reports can be freely distributed.
-   Code that runs on the client should not be trusted.


PBQ
There are three categories when it comes to security controls:  Operational, Technical, and Managerial.
- Operational controls are controls for the human element.  For example, policies and procedures, and training programs are examples of operational controls.
- Technical controls are controls that encompass the hardware and software of the organization, such as operating systems and security appliances.
- Managerial controls relate to the oversight of a system.  Examples could include risk identification or the evaluation and selection of security controls
