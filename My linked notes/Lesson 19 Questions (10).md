A company has thirty servers that run for 125 hours, with three servers that fail. Rounding to the nearest whole number, calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for this scenario.

4.  1,250

Solution

The calculation for Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the total time divided by the number of total failures. In this scenario, the company has 30 servers that run for 125 hours (30x125), with the resulting product of 3,750. This result is then divided by the number of failures (3,750/3), which equals an MTBF of 1,250.

The calculation for Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) is the same test but divided by the number of devices. (30x125)/30, with a result of 125.

This answer choice (B) is derived by dividing the number of running hours by the number of systems. These two figures should be multiplied then divided by the failures for MTBF.

This answer choice (C) is the result prior to dividing by the number of failures. Dividing 3,750 by 3 will give the correct MTBF.

Select the phase of risk management a company has performed if they analyzed workflows and identified critical tasks that could cause their business to fail, if not performed.

1.  Identify mission essential functions

Solution

The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure so it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.

The second phase of risk management is to identify vulnerabilities for each function or workflow. This includes analyzing systems and assets to discover and list any vulnerabilities or weaknesses to which they may be susceptible.

The third phase of risk management is to identify threats. Threats that may take advantage of, exploit, or accidentally trigger vulnerabilities. Threat refers to the sources or motivations of people and things that could cause loss or damage.

The fourth phase of risk management is to analyze business impacts and the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat and the impact of that incident on critical systems.

A company determines the mean amount of time to replace or recover a system. What has the company calculated?

3.  MTTR

Solution

Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) is a measure of the time taken to correct a fault to restore the system to full operation. This is also known as a mean time to replace or recover and is important in determining the overall Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

The Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) represents the expected lifetime of a product and is for items that are repairable, such as a server.

Key Performance Indicators (KPI) determines the reliability of each asset. Main KPIs include MTBF and MTTR.

Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) represents the expected lifetime of a product and is for assets that are not repairable such as a hard drive.

Evaluate the metrics associated with Mission Essential Functions (MEF) to determine which example is demonstrating Work Recovery Time (WRT).

4.  It takes three hours to restore a system from backup, reintegrate the system, and test functionality.

Solution

Work Recovery Time (WRT) is the additional time that it takes to restore data from backup, reintegrate different systems, and test overall functionality. This can also include briefing system users on any changes or different working practices so that the business function is again fully supported.

The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is the longest period of time that a business function outage may occur without causing irrecoverable business failure.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the period following a disaster that an individual IT system may remain offline. This represents the amount of time it takes to identify a problem that exists and perform recovery steps.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the amount of data loss that a system can sustain, measured in time. If a database is destroyed and has an RPO of 24 hours, the data can be recovered to a point not more than 24 hours before the database was infected.

Management of a company identifies priorities during a risk management exercise. By doing so, which risk management approach does management use?

2.  Risk posture


Solution

Risk posture is the overall status of risk management. Risk posture shows which risk response options management can identify and prioritize.

The result of a quantitative or qualitative analysis is a measure of inherent risk. Inherent risk is the level of risk before attempting any type of mitigation.

Transference means assigning risk to a third party, such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities.

Risk avoidance means that management halts the activity that is risk-bearing. For example, management may discontinue a flawed product to avoid risk.
# 6
A company performs risk management. Which action identifies a risk response approach?

2.  A company develops a countermeasure for an identified risk.

Solution

The fifth phase of risk management is identifying risk response. A countermeasure should be identified for each risk and the cost of deploying additional security controls should be assessed.

The first phase of risk management is to identify mission essential functions. Mitigating risk can involve a large amount of expenditure, so it is important to focus efforts. Part of risk management is to analyze workflows and identify the mission essential functions that could cause the whole business to fail if they are not performed.

The second phase of risk management is to identify vulnerabilities for each function or workflow. This includes analyzing systems and assets to discover, and list any vulnerabilities or weaknesses they may be susceptible to.

The fourth phase of risk management is to analyze business impacts, the likelihood of a vulnerability being activated as a security incident by a threat, and the impact that incident may have on critical systems.

A critical server has a high availability requirement of 99.99%. Solve the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) in hh:mm:ss to conclude which option will meet the requirement.

2.  0:49:23 annual downtime

Solution

The Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) metric states the requirement for a particular business function. High availability is usually described as 24x7. For a critical system, availability will be described from 99% to 99.9999%. In this scenario, the requirement is 99.99%, resulting in the maximum downtime of 00:52:34 (calculating MTD for a non-leap year: the total number of minutes is 365*24*60=525600, 0.01% of that is 52.56, 0.56 minutes is 33.6 seconds, resulting in 52 minutes and 34 seconds when rounded to the nearest second). Since 00:49:23 is less downtime than the maximum requirement, this results in the system meeting the requirement.

A downtime of 00:53:56 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.

A downtime of 01:24:19 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.

A downtime of 02:48:42 is more than the maximum annual downtime of 00:52:34. As a result, it is outside of the MTD.

# 10
Management of a company practices qualitative risk when assessing a move of systems to the cloud. How does the company indicate any identified risk factors?

3.  With a classification system


Solution

Qualitative risk assessment uses categories or classifications such as Irreplaceable, High Value, Medium Value, and Low Value.

An Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost in the event of an incident.

Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the amount that would be lost over the course of a year. To calculate the ALE, multiply the SLE by the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).

Transference means assigning risk to a third party, such as an insurance company or a contract with a supplier that defines liabilities.
