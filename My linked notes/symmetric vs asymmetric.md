Symmetric encryption is used for confidentiality. Symmetric encryption is very fast and useful for bulk encryption of large amounts of data. Symmetric encryption cannot be used for authentication or integrity because both parties know the same key.

Asymmetric encryption uses two different but related public and private keys to perform operations. Asymmetric encryption can be used to prove identity, authentication, non-repudiation, and key agreement and exchange.

Symmetric encryption is very fast and useful for bulk encryption of large amounts of data. Symmetric encryption cannot be used for authentication or integrity, because both parties know the same key.

Asymmetric encryption involves substantial computing overhead compared to symmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is inefficient for encrypting or transporting large amounts of data.
