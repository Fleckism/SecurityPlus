![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.gif)88                 You are investigating a Linux server that is the source of suspicious network traffic. At a terminal on the server, which tool could you use to check which

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)89                 What is a zone transfer and which reconnaissance tools can be used to test whether a server will allow one?

  

Use ipconfig to check the IP addresses of the default gateway and the DHCP server. Use arp to check the MAC addresses associated with those IP addresses and investigate possible spoofing. You could also use the route command to verify the properties of the default route.

From a Windows host, the pathping tool can be used to measure latency along a route.

This requires a tool that performs fingerprinting—service and version detection—by examining responses to network probes and comparing them to known responses from common platforms. Nmap is very widely used for this task, or you could use hping or Netcat.

The netstat command can assist, however, use the more favorable ss command-line utility tool that is faster and more human-readable.

A zone transfer is where a domain name server (DNS) allows a client to request all the name records for a domain. nslookup (Windows) and dig (principally Linux) can be used to test whether this query is allowed. You could also mention the dnsenum tool, which will check for zone transfers along with other enumeration tests on DNS infrastructure.

[[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] in the OS and applications software such as web browsers and document readers or in PC and adapter firmware can allow threat actors to run malware and gain a foothold on the network.

Windows XP is a legacy platform that is no longer receiving security updates through normal means. This means that patch management cannot be used to reduce risks from software [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]]. The workstation should be isolated from other systems to reduce the risk of compromise.

Open permissions refers to misconfigured access rights for data folders, network file shares, and cloud storage.

Backup solutions mitigate risks from data loss, where files or information is deleted, corrupted, or otherwise destroyed. Backup does not mitigate risks from data breach, where confidential or private data is stolen (exfiltrated) and made public or sold for criminal profit. Mitigating risks of data breach requires effective secure processing, authorization, and authentication security controls.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)Yes, the system integrator is proposing the use of multiple vendors (the cloud service providers), with potentially complex issues for collecting, storing, and sharing customer personal data across these vendors.

become concerned about an APT risk known to target supply chains within the company''s industry sector and wants you to scan their systems for any sign that they have been targeted already. What are the additional challenges of meeting this request, given the lack of investment?

  

Verify that the vulnerability feed/plug-in/test has been updated with the specific CVE that you need to test for.

A fully non-intrusive solution should be adopted, such as sniffing traffic using a network tap or mirror port. Using the network traffic to detect [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] rather than actively probing each device will not cause system stability issues (though there is greater risk of false positive and false negative results).

False positive.

Collecting network traffic and log data from multiple sources and then analyzing it manually will require many hours of analyst time. The use of threat feeds and intelligence fusion to automate parts of this analysis effort would enable a much swifter response.

With the possibility

of social engineering attacks in mind, what precautions should employees take when the guests are being shown around the office?

  

This is likely to be a social engineering attempt. The help desk should not give out any information or add an account without confirming the caller's identity.

This a watering hole attack, which is an attack in which an attacker targets specific groups or organizations, discovers which websites they frequent, and injects malicious code into those sites.

This could be a social engineering use case where impersonation has occurred. A combination of spear phishing (attack using specific details) and vishing (attack over a voice channel) attacks were used by the impersonator. A type of voice mimicry technology may have been used to sound like the real CEO. A safe approach would be to contact the CEO back on a known mobile number to confirm the request.

Employees should specifically be wary of shoulder surfing attempts to observe passwords and the like.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)224               You are writing a security awareness blog for company CEOs subscribed to your threat platform. Why are backdoors and Trojans different ways of classifying and

identifying malware risks?

225               You are investigating a business email compromise (BEC) incident. The email account of a developer has been accessed remotely over webmail. Investigating

the developer''s workstation finds no indication of a malicious process, but you do locate an unknown USB extension device attached to one of the rear ports. Is this the most likely attack vector, and what type of malware would it implement?

  

A Trojan means a malicious program masquerading as something else; a backdoor is a covert means of accessing a host or network. A Trojan need not necessarily operate a backdoor and a backdoor can be established by exploits other than using Trojans. The term remote access trojan (RAT) is used for the specific combination of Trojan and backdoor.

It is likely that the USB device implements a hardware-based keylogger. This would not necessarily require any malware to be installed or leave any trace in the file system.

248               Which part of a simple cryptographic system must be kept secret—the cipher, the ciphertext, or the key?

  

In cryptography, the security of the message is guaranteed by the security of the key. The system does not depend on hiding the algorithm or the message (security by obscurity).

  

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)249               Considering that cryptographic hashing is one-way and the digest cannot be reversed, what makes hashing a useful security technique?

  

Because two parties can hash the same data and compare checksums to see if they match, hashing can be used for data verification in a variety of situations, including password authentication. Hashes of passwords, rather than the password plaintext, can be stored securely or exchanged for authentication. A hash of a file or a hash code in an electronic message can be verified by both parties.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif)250               Which security property is assured by symmetric encryption?                                      Confidentiality—symmetric ciphers are generally fast and well suited to bulk encrypting large amounts of data.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.gif)251               What are the properties of a public/private key pair?                                                     Each key can reverse the cryptographic operation performed by its pair but cannot reverse an operation performed by itself. The private key must be kept secret by the owner, but the public key is designed to be widely distributed. The private key cannot be determined from the public key, given a sufficient key size.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)270               What is the process of digitally signing a message?                                                       A hashing function is used to create a message digest. The digest is then signed using the sender's private key. The resulting signature can be decrypted by the recipient using the sender's public key and cannot be modified by any other agency. The recipient can calculate his or her own digest of the message and compare it to the signed hash to validate that

the message has not been altered.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)271               In a digital envelope, which key encrypts the session key?                                           The recipient's public key (typically from the server's key pair).

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.gif)272               True or False? Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ensures that a compromise of a server''s private key will not also put copies of traffic sent to that server in the past

at risk of decryption.

  

True. PFS ensures that ephemeral keys are used to encrypt each session. These keys are destroyed after use.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image010.gif)273               Why does Diffie-Hellman underpin perfect forward secrecy (PFS)?                            Diffie-Hellman allows the sender and recipient to derive the same value (the session key) from some other pre-agreed values. Some of these are exchanged, and some kept private, but there is no way for a snooper to work out the secret just from the publicly exchanged values. This means session keys can be created without relying on the server's private key,

and that it is easy to generate ephemeral keys that are different for each session.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)274               What type of bulk encryption cipher mode of operation offers the best security?        Generally, counter modes implementing Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD).

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image003.gif)288               True or false? Cryptography is about keeping things secret so they cannot be used as the basis of a non-repudiation system.

  

False—the usages are not exclusive. There are different types of cryptography and some can be used for non-repudiation. The principle is that if an encryption method (cipher and key) is known only to one person, that person cannot then deny having composed a message. This depends on the algorithm design allowing recipients to decrypt the message but not encrypt it.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)289               How can cryptography support high resiliency?                                                            A complex system might have to support many inputs from devices installed to potentially unsecure locations. A system is seen as resilient if, when a compromise of part of the system, does not allow the compromise of the whole system. Cryptography assists this goal by ensuring the authentication and integrity of messages delivered over the control

system.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)290               For which types of system will a cipher suite that exhibits high latency be problematic?

  

High latency is not desirable in any system really, but it will affect real-time protocols that exchange voice or video most. In network communications, latency makes the initial protocol handshake longer, meaning delay for users and possible application timeout issues.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif)291               What is the relevance of entropy to cryptographic functions?                                       Entropy is a measure of how disordered something is. A disordered ciphertext is desirable, because remaining features of order from the plaintext make the ciphertext vulnerable to analysis. Identical plaintexts need to be initialized with random or counter values when encrypted by the same key, and the cryptosystem needs a source of randomness to generate

strong keys.

Quantum computing works on the principle that its units (qubits) have more properties than the bits used in "classical" computers, notably (and very crudely) that a qubit can have a probability of being 1 or 0 and that inspecting the

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)A threat actor could conceal information within an image file and use that to bypass the DLP system. One thing to note is that attackers could find other ways to implement covertexts (audio or video, for instance) or abuse protocol coding. There are many things that steganalysis needs to be able to scan for! You might also note that steganography is not only a data exfiltration risk.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)319               How does a subject go about obtaining a certificate from a CA?                                  In most cases, the subject generates a key pair then adds the public key along with subject information and certificate type in a certificate signing request (CSR) and submits it to the

CA. If the CA accepts the request, it generates a certificate with the appropriate key usage and validity, signs it, and transmits it to the subject.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)320               What cryptographic information is stored in a digital certificate?                                 The subject's public key and the algorithms used for encryption and hashing. The certificate also stores a digital signature from the issuing CA, establishing the chain of trust.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image007.gif)321               What does it mean if a certificate extension attribute is marked as critical?                 That the application processing the certificate must be able to interpret the extension correctly.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif)337               What are the potential consequences if a company loses control of a private key?      It puts both data confidentiality and identification and authentication systems at risk. Depending on the key usage, the key may be used to decrypt data with authorization. The key could also be used to impersonate a user or computer account.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif)338               You are advising a customer about encryption for data backup security and the key escrow services that you offer. How should you explain the risks of key

escrow and potential mitigations?

  

Escrow refers to archiving the key used to encrypt the customer's backups with your company as a third party. The risk is that an insider attack from your company may be able to decrypt the data backups. This risk can be mitigated by requiring M-of-N access to the escrow keys, reducing the risk of a rogue administrator.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.gif)351               What is the difference between authorization and authentication?                                Authorization means granting the account that has been configured for the user on the computer system the right to make use of a resource. Authorization manages the privileges granted on the resource. Authentication protects the validity of the user account by testing that the person accessing that account is who she/he says she/he is.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.gif)352               What steps should be taken to enroll a new employee on a domain network?              Perform checks to confirm the user's identity, issue authentication credentials securely, assign appropriate permissions/privileges to the account, and ensure accounting mechanisms to audit the user's activity.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)373

  

Why might a PIN be a particularly weak type of ''something-you-know'' authentication?

  

A long personal identification number (PIN) is difficult for users to remember, but a short PIN is easy to crack. A PIN can only be used safely where the number of sequential authentication attempts can be strictly limited.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)374               In what scenario would PAP be considered a secure authentication method?               PAP is a legacy protocol that cannot be considered secure because it transmits plaintext ASCII passwords and has no cryptographic protection. The only way to ensure the security of PAP is to ensure that the endpoints established a secure tunnel (using IPSec, for instance).

True or false? In order to create a service ticket, Kerberos passes the user''s password to the target application server for authentication.

  

False—only the KDC verifies the user credential. The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) sends the user's account details (SID) to the target application for authorization (allocation of permissions), not authentication.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)377               Which property of a plaintext password is most effective at defeating a brute- force attack?

  

No. This is security by obscurity. The file could probably be easily discovered using search tools.

The length of the password. If the password does not have any complexity (if it is just two dictionary words, for instance), it may still be vulnerable to a dictionary-based attack. A

long password may still be vulnerable if the output space is small or if the mechanism used to hash the password is faulty (LM hashes being one example).

advantages of using an HSM over server-based key and certificate management services?

  

A hardware security module (HSM) is optimized for this role and so present a smaller attack surface. It is designed to be tamper-evident to mitigate against insider threat risks. It is also likely to have a better implementation of a random number generator, improving the security properties of key material.

  

397               Which network access control framework supports smart cards?                                  Local logon providers, such as Kerberos, support smart cards, but this is not network access control as the device has already been allowed on the network. The IEEE 802.1X

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)type of network access. They act as pass-thru for an authentication server, which stores and validates the credentials. Some EAP types support smart card or machine authentication.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)398               What is a RADIUS client?                                                                                              A device or server that accepts user connections, often referred to as a network access server (NAS) or as the authenticator. Using RADIUS architecture, the client does not need to be able to perform authentication itself; it performs pass-thru to an AAA server.

423               You are consulting with a company about a new approach to authenticating users.

You suggest there could be cost savings and better support for multifactor

authentication (MFA) if your employees create accounts with a cloud provider. That allows the company''s staff to focus on authorizations and privilege management. What type of service is the cloud vendor performing?

424               What is the process of ensuring new accounts are only created for valid users, only assigned the appropriate privileges, and that the account credentials are

known only to the valid user?

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif)425               What is the policy that states users should be allocated the minimum sufficient permissions?

  

The cloud vendor is acting as the identity provider.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)428               Recently, attackers were able to compromise the account of a user whose employment had been terminated a week earlier. They used this account to access

a network share and delete important files. What account vulnerability enabled this attack?

  

Shared authority, job rotation, and mandatory enforced vacation/holidays.

While it's possible that lax password requirements and incorrect privileges may have contributed to the account compromise, the most glaring problem is that the terminated employee's account wasn't disabled. Since the account was no longer being used, it should not have been left active for a malicious user to exploit.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)429               For what type of account would interactive logon be disabled?                                    Interactive logon refers to starting a shell. Service accounts do not require this type of access. Default superuser accounts, such as Administrator and root, may also be disabled, or limited to use in system recovery or repair.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif)430               Third-party host access credentials should be properly managed. Which types of these credentials may be configured with a password or cryptographic keys

within code?

  

SSH and API keys are often unsecurely embedded in computer code or uploaded mistakenly to repositories alongside code. Also, managing shared credentials can be difficult, and many sites resort to storing them in a shared spreadsheet.

Enforce password history.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.gif)439               In what two ways can an IP address be used for context-based authentication?           An IP address can represent a logical location (subnet) on a private network. Most types of public IP address can be linked to a geographical location, based on information published by the registrant that manages that block of IP address space.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)440               How does accounting provide non-repudiation?                                                            A user's actions are logged on the system. Each user is associated with a unique computer account. As long as the user's authentication is secure and the logging system is tamper- proof, they cannot deny having performed the action.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)441               Which information resource is required to complete [[usage auditing]]?                           
Usage events must be recorded in a log. Choosing which events to log will be guided by an audit policy.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif)442               What is the difference between locked and disabled accounts?                                     An account enters a locked state because of a policy violation, such as an incorrect password being entered incorrectly. Lockout is usually applied for a limited duration. An account is usually disabled manually, using the account properties. A disabled account can only be re-enabled manually.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image007.gif)443               PAM (privileged access management)                                                                            Policies, procedures, and support software for managing accounts and credentials with administrative permissions.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif)469               Your company has been the victim of several successful phishing attempts over the past year. Attackers managed to steal credentials from these attacks and used

them to compromise key systems. What vulnerability contributed to the success of these social engineers, and why?

  

A lack of proper user training directly contributes to the success of social engineering attempts. Attackers can easily trick users when those users are unfamiliar with the characteristics and ramifications of such deception.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif)470               Why should an organization design role-based training programs?                              Employees have different levels of technical knowledge and different work priorities. This means that a "one size fits all" approach to security training is impractical.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)471               You are planning a security awareness program for a manufacturer. Is a pamphlet likely to be sufficient in terms of resources?

  

Using a diversity of training techniques will boost engagement and retention. Practical tasks, such as phishing simulations, will give attendees more direct experience. Workshops or computer-based training will make it easier to assess whether the training has been completed.

A recent security evaluation concluded that your company''s network design is too consolidated. Hosts with wildly different functions and purposes are grouped together on the same logical area of the network. In the past, this has enabled attackers to easily compromise large swaths of network hosts. What technique(s) do you suggest will improve the security of the network''s design, and why?

  

In general, you should start implementing some form of network segmentation to put hosts with the same security requirements within segregated zones. For example, the workstations in each business department can be grouped in their own subnets to prevent a compromise of one subnet from spreading to another. Likewise, with VLANs, you can more easily manage the logical segmentation of the network without disrupting the physical infrastructure (i.e., devices and cabling).

How can you

explain it?

  

The Internet is an external zone where none of the hosts accessing your services can be assumed trusted or authenticated. An extranet is a zone allowing controlled access to semi- trusted hosts, implying some sort of authentication. The hosts are semi-trusted because they are not under the administrative control of the organization (as they are owned by suppliers, customers, business partners, contractors, and so on).

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)804               True or false? A maliciously designed USB battery charger could be used to exploit a mobile device on connection.

  

An attacker might set up some sort of rogue access point (Wi-Fi) or cell tower (cellular) to perform eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks. For Personal Area Network (PAN)

range communications, there might be an opportunity for an attacker to run exploit code over the channel.

This would allow a PC or laptop to connect to the Internet via the smartphone's cellular data connection. This could be used to evade network security mechanisms, such as data loss prevention or content filtering.

True (in theory)—though the vector is known to the mobile OS and handset vendors so the exploit is unlikely to be able to run without user authorization.

You are providing security advice and training to a customer''s technical team. One asks how they can identify when a buffer overflow occurs. What is your answer?

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)Real-time detection of a buffer overflow is difficult, and is typically only achieved by security monitoring software (antivirus, endpoint detection and response, or user and entity behavior analytics) or by observing the host closely within a sandbox. An unsuccessful attempt is likely to cause the process to crash with an error message. If the attempt is successful, the process is likely to show anomalous behavior, such as starting another process, opening network connections or writing to AutoRun keys in the registry. These indicators can be recorded using logging and system monitoring tools.

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)826               What is the effect of a memory leak?                                                                              A process claims memory locations but never releases them, reducing the amount of memory available to other processes. This will damage performance, could prevent other processes from starting, and if left unchecked could crash the OS.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)827               How can DLL injection be exploited to hide the presence of malware?                        Various OS system functions allow one process to manipulate another and force it to load a dynamic link library (DLL). This means that the malware code can be migrated from one process to another, evading detection.

  

828               Other than endpoint protection software, what resource can provide indicators of pass the hash attacks?

  

These attacks are revealed by use of certain modes of NTLM authentication within the security (audit) log of the source and target hosts. These indicators can be prone to false positives, however, as many services use NTLM authentication legitimately.

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)853               You are improving back-end database security to ensure that requests deriving from front-end web servers are authenticated. What general class of attack is this

designed to mitigate?

  

The attacker needs to find a vulnerable input method, such as a form control or URL or script parser, that will allow the execution of OS shell commands.

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) causes a public server to make an arbitrary request to a back-end server. This is made much harder if the threat actor has to defeat an authentication or authorization mechanism between the web server and the database server.

889               You have been asked to investigate a web server for possible intrusion. You identify a script with the following code. What language is the code in and does it

seem likely to be malicious? import os, sockets, syslog def r_conn(ip) s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM) s.connect(("logging.trusted.foo",514)) ...

  

![](file:///C:/Users/Jamie/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)The code is written in Python. It uses various modules with default library code to interact with the OS and network, and also the syslog logging platform. The first lines of code define a function to connect to a host over port 514 (syslog). SOCK_DGRAM is a UDP connection, which is standard for syslog. Most likely the script is for remote logging and unlikely to be malicious, especially if trusted.foo is a known domain.
