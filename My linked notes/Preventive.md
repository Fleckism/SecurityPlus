==Preventive==â€”the control acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventative control operates before an attack can take place. Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects are preventative-type controls. Anti-malware software also acts as a preventative control, by blocking processes identified as malicious from executing. Directives and standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be thought of as administrative versions of preventative controls.
