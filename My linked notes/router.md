A device that forwards data from one network to another. Based on an internal routing table and the address of the destination network in the incoming packet, the router determines whether to send the packet out or keep it within the network. The traffic traversing a router is formatted in a routable protocol, the global standard being TCP/IP, or simply IP (see [TCP/IP](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/tcpip) and [routable protocol](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/routable-protocol)).

**At Home**

In the home or small office, a "wireless router" or "wireless gateway" is used to manage Internet traffic. The wireless router contains a built-in Ethernet switch and Wi-Fi access point (see [wireless router](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/wireless-router)), and the wireless gateway also includes a modem (see [cable/DSL gateway](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/cabledsl-gateway)). Both router and gateway have one or two Ethernet ports to the Internet (see [Ethernet adapter](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/ethernet-adapter)).

**In a Company**

In the enterprise, routers in the local network (LAN) are dedicated to packet forwarding and connect to stand-alone modems and Wi-Fi access points. Although routers have built-in Ethernet ports, they are often connected to Ethernet switches that reach a larger number of computers and printers. See [Ethernet switch](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/ethernet-switch) and [access point](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/access-point).

**Routers in the Core**

Within a large enterprise, routers separate local area networks (LANs) into subnetworks (subnets) to balance traffic within workgroups and to filter traffic for security purposes and policy management. They also forward packets between the company's LANs, private external networks (WANs) and the Internet. Factors such as traffic load, external line costs and congestion may be taken into consideration to determine which port to forward to. See [LAN](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/lan) and [WAN](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/wan).

Within the Internet, very large-scale routers do all the packet switching between the national and regional backbones and are typically connected via optical fibers. Measured in millions of packets per second (see [PPS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/pps)), large routers handle enormous amounts of traffic.

**A Huge Range of Prices**

Routers range from $50 to tens of thousands. Home wireless routers from companies such as D-Link, NETGEAR and Grandstream are the least expensive, while enterprise and Internet core routers from companies such as Cisco, Brocade and Huawei are the most costly. See [packet switching](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/packet-switching), [Ethernet](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/ethernet), [SONET](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/sonet), [edge router](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/edge-router) and [collapsed backbone](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/collapsed-backbone).

**A Windows PC Can Be a Router**

Routers are normally dedicated communications devices; however, a Windows PC can be turned into a router with NAT32 software (www.nat32.com).

**Router Terminology**

Routers used to be called "gateways," which is why the term "default gateway" means the router in the network (see [default gateway](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/default-gateway)). For more details on the routable protocol layer, see [OSI model](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/osi-model) and [TCP/IP abc's](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/tcpip-abcs). See [layer 3 switch](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/layer-3-switch), [route server](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/route-server), [router cluster](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/router-cluster) and [routing protocol](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/routing-protocol).

**Route Forwarding**

Routing tables hold the data for making forwarding decisions. Although this is a simple example, routing tables become very complex. Static routing uses fixed tables, but dynamic routing uses routing protocols that let routers exchange data with each other.

**Cisco Routers**

For years, Cisco has been the leading router vendor, and these high-end, carrier-grade models process many millions of packets per second (pps). _(Image courtesy of Cisco Systems, Inc.)_
