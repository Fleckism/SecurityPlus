confidentiality, integrity, and availability

-  **Confidentiality** means that certain information should only be known to certain people. 
-   **Integrity** means that the data is stored and transferred as intended and that modification is only done by authorized sources. 
-   **Availability** means that information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it. 

The triad can also be referred to as "AIC" to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.  

Some security models and researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit. The most important of these is non-repudiation. 

- **Non-repudiation** means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as creating, modifying, or sending a resource. For example, a legal document, such as a will, must usually be witnessed when it is signed. If there is a dispute about whether the document was correctly executed, the witness can provide evidence that it was.
