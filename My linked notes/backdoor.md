Any type of access method to a host that **circumvents the usual authentication method and gives the remote user administrative control** can be referred to as a [[backdoor]]. 

A remote access trojan (RAT) is backdoor #malware that mimics the functionality of legitimate remote control programs, but is designed specifically to operate covertly. Once the RAT is installed, it allows the [[threat actor]] to access the host, upload files, and install software or use "live off the land" techniques to effect further compromises.Â 

Backdoors can be created in other ways than infection by [[malware]]. Programmers may create backdoors in software applications for testing and development that are subsequently not removed when the application is deployed. [[backdoor]]s are also created by misconfiguration of software or hardware that allows access to unauthorized users. Examples include leaving a router configured with the default administrative password, having a Remote Desktop connection configured with an unsecure password, or leaving a modem open to receive dial-up connections.

A mechanism for gaining access to a computer that bypasses or subverts the normal method of authentication.
