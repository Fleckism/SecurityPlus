Security through obscurity involves keeping something a secret by hiding it. With cryptography, messages do not need to be hidden since they are not understandable unless decrypted.

Non-repudiation is when the sender cannot deny sending the message. If the message has been encrypted in a way known only to the sender, logic follows the sender must have composed it.

Obfuscation is the art of making a message difficult to understand. Cryptography is a very effective way of obfuscating a message by encrypting it.

Resiliency occurs when the compromise of a small part of the system is prevented from allowing compromise of the whole system. Cryptography ensures the authentication and integrity of messages delivered over the control system.
