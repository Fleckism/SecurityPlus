**File Transfer Protocol** (FTP) 
- server is typically configured with several public directories, hosting files, and user accounts. 
- Most HTTP servers also function as FTP servers, and FTP services, accounts, and directories may be installed and enabled by default when you install a web server. FTP is more efficient compared to file attachments or HTTP file transfer, but has **no security mechanisms**. All authentication and data transfer are communicated as plaintext, meaning that credentials can easily be picked out of any intercepted FTP traffic.

You should check that users do not install unauthorized servers on their PCs (a rogue server). For example, a version of IIS that includes HTTP, FTP, and SMTP servers is shipped with client versions of Windows, though it is not installed by default.
