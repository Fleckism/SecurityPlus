**Topology discovery** (or "[[footprinting]]") means **scanning** for 
- hosts 
- IP ranges
- routes between networks to map out the structure of the target network. 
- Can also be used to build an 
- asset database and to 
- identify non-authorized hosts (rogue system detection)
- network configuration errors.

Basic topology discovery tasks can be accomplished using the command line tools built into Windows and Linux.Â The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">following tools report the IP configuration and test connectivity on the local network segment or subnet</mark> .

performed using a dedicated IP scanner tool. An IP scanner performs host discovery and identifies how the hosts are connected together in an internetwork.
