**Topology discovery** (or "footprinting") means scanning for hosts, IP ranges, and routes between networks to map out the structure of the target network. Topology discovery can also be used to build an asset database and to identify non-authorized hosts (rogue system detection) or network configuration errors.

Basic topology discovery tasks can be accomplished using the command line tools built into Windows and Linux. The following tools report the IP configuration and test connectivity on the local network segment or subnet.

performed using a dedicated IP scanner tool. An IP scanner performs host discovery and identifies how the hosts are connected together in an internetwork
