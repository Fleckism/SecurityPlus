==A set of ordered steps for solving a problem==, such as a mathematical formula or the instructions in a program. The terms algorithm and "program logic" are synonymous as both refer to a sequence of steps to solve a problem. However, an algorithm often implies a more complex problem rather than the input-process-output logic of typical business software.

 # Types 
 - [[RSA]]
 - [[DSA]]
 - [[SHA]]
 - [[MD5]]
 - key hash
[[PFS]] can be implemented using either the Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode ([[DHE]] or [[EDH]]) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode ([[ECDHE]]) [[algorithm|algorithms]]. To use PFS, the server and client must negotiate use of a mutually supported cipher suite.

# Encryption algorithm
A formula used to turn ordinary data, or "plaintext," into a secret coded message known as "ciphertext." The ciphertext can reside in storage or travel over unsecure networks without its contents being divulged to unauthorized people.

Also known as a "cipher," each algorithm uses a randomly generated string of bits known as a "key" to perform the calculations. The larger the key (the more bits), the greater the number of potential patterns can be created, thus making it harder to break the code and decrypt the contents.

Most encryption algorithms use the block cipher method, which codes fixed blocks of input. Others use the stream method, which encrypts one bit at a time
