**Threat** is a process that magnifies the likelihood of a negative event, such as the exploit of a vulnerability.

A **Threat** is a possible security violation.

Whether a backdoor is used as a standalone intrusion mechanism or to manage bots, the threat actor must establish a connection from the compromised host to a command and control [[C2]] or [[C&C]] host or network. This network connection is usually the best way to identify the presence of a RAT, backdoor, or bot. There are many means of implementing a C&C network as a covert channel to evade detection and filtering. Historically, the Internet relay chat (IRC) protocol was popular. Modern methods are more likely to use command sequences embedded in HTTPS or DNS traffic.
