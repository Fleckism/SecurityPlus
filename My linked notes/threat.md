==Insider threats== are the greatest threat to an organization. They involve disgruntled employees that steal data or employees that fall for threats such as phishing attacks. There are plenty of anecdotal stories available explaining how an employee who had access was capable of crippling business systems, stealing clients, exfiltrating company secrets, and more.

Whether a backdoor is used as a standalone intrusion mechanism or to manage bots, the [[threat actor]] must establish a connection from the compromised host to a command and control [[C2]] or [[C&C]] host or network. This network connection is usually the best way to identify the presence of a RAT, backdoor, or bot. There are many means of implementing a C&C network as a covert channel to evade detection and filtering. Historically, the Internet relay chat ([[IRC]]) protocol was popular. Modern methods are more likely to use command sequences embedded in HTTPS or DNS traffic.Â
