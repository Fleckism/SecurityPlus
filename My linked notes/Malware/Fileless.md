[[Fileless]] (maleware) is not a definitive classification, but it describes a collection of common behaviors and techniques:

Fileless [[malware]] does not write its code to disk. The malware uses memory resident techniques to run in its own process, within a host process or dynamic link library ([[DLL]]), or within a scripting host. This does not mean that there is no disk activity at all, however. The malware may change registry values to achieve persistence (executing if the host computer is restarted). The initial execution of the malware may also depend on the user running a downloaded script, file attachment, or **Trojan software package**.
-   Fileless malware uses lightweight **shellcode** to achieve a [[backdoor]] mechanism on the host. The shellcode is easy to recompile in an obfuscated form to evade detection by scanners. It is then able to download additional packages or payloads to achieve the actor's actions and/orÂ objectives. These packages can also be obfuscated, streamed, and compiled on the fly to evade automated detection.
-   Fileless malware may use "live off the land" techniques rather than compiled executables to evade detection. **This means that the malware code uses legitimate system scripting tools, notably PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), to execute payload actions.** If they can be executed with sufficient permissions, these environments provide all the tools the attacker needs to perform scanning, reconfigure settings, and exfiltrate data.
