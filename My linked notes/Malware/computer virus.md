A [[computer virus]] is a type of malware designed to replicate and spread from computer to computer:

-   **[[Non-resident/file infector]]**—the virus is contained within a host executable file and runs with the host process. 
-   **[[Memory resident]]**—when the host file is executed, the virus creates a new process for itself in memory. 
-   **[[Boot]]**—the virus code is written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media.
-   **[[Script and macro viruses]]**—the malware uses the programming features available in local scripting engines for the OS and/or browser, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), JavaScript, Microsoft Office documents with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code enabled, or PDF documents with JavaScript enabled.

In addition, the term **[[multipartite]]** is used for viruses that use multiple vectors and **[[polymorphic]]** for viruses that can dynamically change or obfuscate their code to evade detection.

**What these types of viruses have in common is that they must infect a host file or media.** An infected file can be distributed through any normal means—on a disk, on a network, as an attachment to an email or social media post, or as a download from a website.
