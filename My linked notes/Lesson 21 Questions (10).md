A security team is setting up a secure room for sensitive systems which may have active wireless connections that are prone to eavesdropping. Which solution does the team secure the systems with to remedy the situation?


3.  Faraday cage


Solution

A faraday cage is an enclosure that features a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area.

A vault is a room that is hardened against unauthorized entry by physical means, such as drilling or explosives.

Some data centers may contain racks with equipment owned by different companies (colocation). Technicians can install these racks inside cages so that they can only physically access the racks housing their own company's servers.

A physical DMZ is a location or an empty area surrounding a high-value asset, which security closely monitors for intrusions.

An organization plans the destruction of old HDDs. In an effort to save money, the organization damages the media by impact, but they did not destroy all of the data. Which method has the organization tried?

4.  Pulverizing

Solution

Pulverizing involves destroying media by impact. It is important to note that hitting a hard drive with a hammer can actually leave a surprising amount of recoverable data. Industrial machinery should perform this type of destruction.

Degaussing involves exposing a magnetic hard disk to a powerful electromagnet. This disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface.

Pulping involves mixing any shredded remains of destroyed documents with water to provide an extra measure of protection.

Shredders destroy documents. Some shredders are powerful enough to destroy optical media too. Industrial shredders can destroy hard drives and flash drives.

The security team at an organization looks to protect highly confidential servers. Which method does the team propose when protecting the servers against explosives?

4.  Vault

Solution

A vault is a room that is hardened against unauthorized entry by physical means, such as drilling or explosives.

An air gapped host is one that is not physically connected to any network. Such a host would also normally have stringent physical access controls, such as housing it within a secure enclosure.

A faraday cage is an enclosure that features a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area.

Some data centers may contain racks with equipment owned by different companies (colocation). Technicians can install these racks inside cages so that they can only physically access the racks housing their own company's servers.
# 4
An organization plans the destruction of old flash drives. In an attempt to erase the media, an employee uses an electromagnet, only to discover that it did not destroy the data. Which method has the employee tried?

2.  Degaussing

Solution

Degaussing involves exposing a magnetic hard disk to a powerful electromagnet. This disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface. Degaussing cannot erase non-magnetic disks, such as flash drives.

Pulping involves mixing any shredded remains of destroyed documents with water to provide an extra measure of protection.

Pulverizing involves destroying media by impact. It is important to note that hitting a hard drive with a hammer can actually leave a surprising amount of recoverable data. Industrial machinery should perform this type of destruction.

Burning or incineration is an effective method for all media types, as long as a furnace designed for media sanitization performs the task.

Compare physical access controls with network security to identify the statements that accurately connect the similarities between them. **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  Authentication provides users access through the barriers, while authorization determines the barriers around a resource.
2.  An example of authentication in networking is a user logging into the network with a smart card. Similarly, authentication in physical security is demonstrated by an employee using a badge to enter a building.


Solution

Authentication creates access lists and identification mechanisms to allow approved persons through the barriers.

Authorization determines the barriers around a resource so that access can be controlled through defined entry and exit points.

An example of authentication is a user who logs into a network with a smart card. In terms of physical security, authentication is represented by an employee using a badge to enter a building.

An example of authorization is used to determine which files a user has on the network after authenticating. In physical security, the same can be said of the barriers in place to determine which employees can access a controlled room.

A secure data center has multiple alarms installed for security. Compare the features of the types of alarms that may be installed, and determine which is an example of a circuit alarm.

1.  Windows and emergency exits along the perimeter will sound an alarm when opened.

Solution

Circuit alarms sound when the circuit is opened or closed. This could be caused by a door or window opening.

A motion-based alarm is linked to a detector triggered by any movement within an area, such as a room.

Duress alarms are triggered manually by staff if they come under threat. There are many ways of implementing this type of alarm which include a panic button under a desk.

Pendants are also an example of a duress alarm. These can be pushed without alerting an intruder or attacker and will silently call for assistance.
# 7
Which of the following are appropriate methods of media sanitization? **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  Use random data to overwrite data on each location of a hard drive.
2.  Reset a disk to its factory condition utilizing tools provided by the vendor.
3.  Degauss a hard drive using a machine with a powerful electromagnet.

Solution

There are several ways to perform media sanitization, defined as decommissioning various media, including hard drives, flash drives, and tape media. Data sanitization can be performed by overwriting old data on each location on the media using either zeroes or a random pattern.

Low-level format can be used to reset a disk to its factory condition. Most disk vendors supply tools to reset a disk and is often described as low-level format tools. It will have the same type of effect as disk wiping software.

A magnetic disk can be mechanically shredded or degaussed, exposing the disk to a powerful electromagnet. The machine used to perform this action is costly and will render the disk unusable, meaning it cannot be repurposed or resold.

Optical media cannot be reformatted. Discs should be destroyed before discarding. Shredders are available for destroying Compact Disks (CDs).
# 8
An engineer receives an alert from a mobile system equipped with an RFID tag. Upon investigating, the mobile system is missing from its assigned station. Which alarm type prompted the engineer to investigate?

2.  Proximity

Solution

A proximity alarm may use radio frequency ID (RFID) tags and readers that can track the movement of tagged objects within an area. This can form the basis of an alarm system to detect whether someone is trying to remove equipment.

Employees manually trigger a duress alarm if they come under threat. There are many ways of implementing this type of alarm. An automobile key fob with a panic button is an example of a duress alarm.

Linked to a detector, a motion-based alarm is triggered by any movement within an area (defined by the sensitivity and range of the detector).

A circuit-based alarm sounds when the circuit is opened or closed, depending on the type of alarm. A door or window opening or a fence being cut can trigger the alarm.
# 9
A project manager has designed a new secure data center and has decided to use multifactor locks on each door to prevent unauthorized access. Compare the following types of locks that the project manager may use to determine which example the facility is utilizing.

1.  A lock that requires an employee to use a smart card and pin to enter

Solution

A multifactor lock is one that may combine different methods to enter, such as a smart card with a PIN.

A token-based lock is a smart lock that opens using a magnetic swipe card or features a proximity reader, to detect the presence of a wireless key fob or a one-time password generator.

An electronic lock operates by entering a PIN on an electronic keypad. A cipher, a combination, or keyless are other names for this type of lock.

A deadbolt is a bolt on the frame of the door, separate from the handle mechanism.
# 10
A project manager is developing a site layout for a new facility. Consider the principles of site layout design to recommend the best plan for the project.


3.  Minimize traffic passing between zones so that the flow of people are in and out, instead of across and between.


Solution

The project manager should try to minimize traffic having to pass between zones. The flow of people should be in and out, rather than across and between.

Secure zones, such as equipment rooms, should be located as deep within the building as possible. External walls, doors, and windows should be avoided for these rooms.

Security mechanisms in public areas should be high visibility to increase deterrence. Use signs and warnings to enforce the idea that security is tightly controlled.

In secure zones, do not position display screens or input devices facing toward pathways or windows. Alternatively, use one-way glass so that no one can look in through windows.
