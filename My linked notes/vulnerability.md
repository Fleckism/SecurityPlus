**vulnerability** is a weakness in your infrastructure, networks or applications that **potentially exposes you to threats**.
#VariationsOfSpelling
#vulnerability scanning uses lists of patches and standard definitions of baseline configurations.

A vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a [[[[threat actor]]]].

==list out all malware types this tab should be all inclusive!==

- [[Software exploitation]] means an attack that targets a [[vulnerability]] in software code. 
- An [[application vulnerability]] is a design flaw that can cause the security system to be circumvented or that will cause the application to crash. 
- A [[vulnerability]] that is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch is called a **zero-day**.
- Network appliances with weak settings can allow attackers to move through the network unhindered and snoop on traffic
- An unsecured root account is one that an adversary is able to gain control of, either by guessing a weak password or by using some **local boot attack to set or change the password*
- [[Open permissions]] refers to provisioning data files or applications without differentiating access rights for user groups

- [[application vulnerability]]
- [[zero-day]]

-   Operating system (OS)—an application [[exploit]] will run with the permissions of the logged on user, which will hopefully be limited. A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library is more likely to allow   **privilege escalation**, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Dirty COW is one example of a Linux kernel vulnerability ([access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141)).
-   Firmware—vulnerabilities can exist in the BIOS/UEFI firmware that controls the boot process for PCs. There can also be bugs in device firmware, such as network cards and disk controllers. Finally, network appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices run OS code as a type of firmware. Like kernel vulnerabilities, firmware exploits can be difficult to identify, because the exploit code can run with the highest level of privilege. The Intel AMT vulnerability illustrates the impacts of a firmware vulnerability ([blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf)).
