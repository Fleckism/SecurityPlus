A blackhole is an area of the network that cannot reach any other part of the network. The blackhole option is **preferred**, as evaluating each packet in a multi-gigabit stream against ACLs overwhelms the processing resources available. A standard method of doing this with border gateway protocol ([[BGP]]) routing is called a remotely triggered blackhole ([[RTBH]]) ([cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/security/intelligence/blackhole.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/blackhole.pdf)). The blackhole also makes the attack less damaging to the ISP's other customers. With both approaches, legitimate traffic is discarded along with the DDoS packets.
