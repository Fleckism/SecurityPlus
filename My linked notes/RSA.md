algorithm provides the mathematical properties for deriving key pairs and performing the encryption and decryption operations. This type of algorithm is called a trapdoor function, because it is easy to perform using the public key, but difficult to reverse without knowing the private key.

RSA key pair security depends on the difficulty of finding the prime factors of very large integers (modular exponentiation).
