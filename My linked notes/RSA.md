- Is an [[algorithm]] 
- trapdoor function, because it is easy to perform using the public key, but difficult to reverse without knowing the private key.
- key size of 2048 in **RSA** is comparable to an [[ECC]] of 256 bits
- Weaker than ECC

RSA key pair security depends on the difficulty of finding the prime factors of very large integers (**modular exponentiation**).

# Full description
Is an **algorithm** provides the mathematical properties for deriving key pairs and performing the encryption and decryption operations. This type of algorithm is called a trapdoor function, because it is easy to perform using the public key, but difficult to reverse without knowing the private key.
