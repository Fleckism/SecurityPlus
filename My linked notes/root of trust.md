A hardware [[Root of Trust]] (RoT) or trust anchor is a secure subsystem that is able to provide attestation. **Attestation means that a statement made by the system can be trusted by the receiver.** For example, when a computer joins a network, it might submit a report to the network access control ([[NAC]]) server declaring, "My operating system files have not been replaced with malicious versions." The hardware [[root of trust]] is used to scan the boot metrics and OS files to verify their signatures, then it signs the report. The NAC server can trust the signature and therefore the report contests if it can trust that the signing entity's private key is secure.Â
