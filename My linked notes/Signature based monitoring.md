Signature-based monitoring analyzes frames and packets of network traffic for predetermined attack patterns. The attack patterns are known as signatures. A benefit of using signature-based engines is that they tend to be more lightweight and less resource-intensive, as it is more of a comparison than dynamic evaluation. This makes them inherently more vulnerable to zero-day attacks because of the delay before a signature is made and distributed. Zero-day attacks are best mitigated with behavior- or anomaly-based detection methods.
