An attacker uses spoofed GPS coordinates on a stolen mobile device, attempting to gain access to an enterprise network. Which statement best describes the attack vector?


4.  The attacker uses spoofed coordinates to defeat geofencing on the target network.

Solution

An attacker can spoof GPS signals using specialist radio equipment to defeat geofencing mechanisms. Geofencing can create a virtual network boundary (based on real-world geography) that utilizes context-aware authentication for establishing a network perimeter on a company’s premises.

A host operating system may provision an isolated execution environment for an application with containerization.

Bluesnarfing uses an exploit in Bluetooth to steal information from someone else's phone. The exploit (now patched) allows attackers to circumvent the authentication mechanism.

An attacker installs a rogue wireless access point (WAP)—with a smartphone with tethering capabilities, for example—on a network without authorization. An unauthorized WAP creates a backdoor.

An attacker steals personal data from a user device with an outdated Bluetooth authentication mechanism. What type of attack has occurred?


2.  Bluesnarfing
3.  Bluetooth jamming
4.  Jailbreaking

Solution

Bluesnarfing refers to using an exploit in Bluetooth to steal information from someone else's phone. The exploit (now patched) allows attackers to circumvent the authentication mechanism. Even without an exploit, a short (4-digit) PIN code is vulnerable to brute force password guessing.

Unless the owner configures some form of authentication, a discoverable device is vulnerable to bluejacking, a type of spam where the victim receives an unsolicited text (or picture/video) message or vCard (contact details).

Bluetooth is generally less susceptible to jamming than Wi-Fi or GPS signals.

Jailbreaking occurs when an attacker gains root privileges. An attacker may use jailbreaking to sideload apps, change or add mobile carriers, or customize OS interfaces.

Which microwave connection mode is most appropriate for forming a strong connection between two sites?

1.  P2P


Solution

A point-to-point topology occurs when two nodes have a dedicated connection to one another. In a point-to-multipoint topology, a central node mediates links between remote nodes.

Point-to-multipoint (P2M) microwave uses smaller sectoral antennas, each covering a separate quadrant. Where P2P is between two sites, P2M links multiple sites or subscriber nodes to a single hub.

Over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates are delivered to radio devices via a cellular data connection.

The USB on the go (OTG) specification allows a mobile device to act as a host when a device, such as an external drive or keyboard, is attached. USB OTG allows a port to function either as a host or as a device.

A user facing a tight deadline at work experiences difficulties logging in to a network workstation, so the user activates a smartphone hotspot and connects a personal laptop to save time. Which of the following vulnerabilities has the user potentially created for the enterprise environment?


4.  The device may circumvent data loss prevention and web content filtering policies.

Solution

Wi-Fi hotspot functionality should typically be disabled when a device is connected to an enterprise network, as it might circumvent security mechanisms, such as data loss prevention or web content filtering policies.

A Bluetooth-enabled device in discoverable mode can connect to any other nearby Bluetooth devices. Even when in non-discoverable mode, an attacker may easily detect Bluetooth devices and exploit simple authentication methods.

One type of radio frequency ID (RFID) attack is skimming, where an attacker uses a fraudulent RFID reader to read the signals from a contactless bank card.

Global positioning system (GPS) jamming or spoofing might defeat geofencing mechanisms.

Analyze and compare iOS and Android operating systems (OS) to accurately differentiate between the two. **(Select all that apply.)**


2.  iOS is limited to Apple products, while Android has multiple hardware vendors.
3.  Android is an open source OS based on Linux, unlike iOS, which is a closed and proprietary system.


Solution

iOS is the operating system for Apple's iPhone and iPad tablet. Android is an OS for smartphones and tablets, and is an open source OS. This provides more scope for hardware vendors such as Asus, LG, and Samsung.

Android is an open source OS based on Linux. iOS is a closed and proprietary system.

Apple makes new versions freely available for iOS, with devices typically updated very quickly. Android offers updates more sporadically, as updates are often dependent on the handset vendor to complete.

Android is more vulnerable to attack than iOS. Sporadic updates along with apps being installed from multiple vendors, reduces the security on the devices. iOS is a closed source with frequent updates, providing more security.

Pilots in an Air Force unit utilize government-issued tablet devices loaded with navigational charts and aviation publications, with all other applications disabled. This illustrates which type of mobile device deployment?


2.  COBO


Solution

The company owns the device and dictates the device’s purpose in the corporate owned, business only (COBO) model.

Employees own their own devices that meet business configuration standards and run corporate applications in the bring your own device (BYOD) model. Businesses may oversee and audit user-owned devices to some extent, but this model poses significant security challenges.

In the corporate owned, personally-enabled (COPE) model, the company chooses, supplies, and owns the device, but authorizes personal use, (subject to acceptable use policies).

With choose your own device (CYOD), the company owns and supplies the device, but the employee chooses it.

Analyze mobile device deployment models to select the best explanation of the Corporate Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE) deployment model.

1.  The employee may use the mobile device to access personal email and social media accounts. The device is chosen and supplied by the company.


Solution

A Corporate Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE) device is chosen and supplied by the company and remains its property. The employee may use it to access personal email and social media accounts.

A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model is owned and supplied by the employee. The employee may use it to access personal email and social media accounts.

A Corporate Owned, Business Only (COBO) device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.

A Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) is much like COPE, but the employee is given a choice of a device from a list.
# 8
Analyze the following scenarios and determine which accurately describes the use of an ad hoc Wi-Fi network.

1.  Two or more wireless devices connect to each other on a temporary basis.

Solution

Multiple wireless devices can establish peer-to-peer connections with one another, rather than using an access point. The devices will operate in ad hoc mode rather than infrastructure mode and are meant to be temporary networks.

A smartphone can share its mobile data connection with a PC, for example, via USB. This type of connection is commonly referred to as tethering where the smartphone acts as a hotspot.

A mobile device creates a personal area network (PAN) when connecting to peripherals like a wireless speaker or keyboard via Bluetooth for example.

A smartphone tethers to share a connection via a Bluetooth connection with a single PC. The term "Wi-Fi tethering" is also widely used to mean a hotspot.
# 9
The owner of a company asks a network manager to recommend a mobile device deployment model for implementation across the company. The owner states security is the number one priority. Which deployment model should the network manager recommend for implementation?


4.  COBO because the company retains the most control over the device and applications.

Solution

Corporate Owned, Business Only (COBO) devices provide the greatest security of the four mobile device deployment models. The device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.

The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model is the least secure of the four models. The device is owned by the employee, and the employee agrees to use it for company use.

Deploying a Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) model means the device is chosen by the employee and owned by the company. The employee is able to use the device for personal business.

A Corporate Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE) device is supplied and chosen by the company and personal use is allowed.
# 10
A user would like to install an application on a mobile device that is not authorized by the vendor. The user decides the best way to accomplish the install is to perform rooting on the device. Compare methods for obtaining access to conclude which type of device the user has, and what actions the user has taken.


2.  The user has an Android device and has used custom firmware to gain access to the administrator account.

Solution

Rooting is a term associated with Android devices. Some vendors provide authorized mechanisms for users to access the root account on their device. For some devices, it is necessary to exploit a vulnerability or use custom firmware.

A user who has an iOS device and wants access to the administrator account will perform an action called jailbreaking versus rooting.

If the user had an iOS device, and has booted the device with a patched kernel, the term would have been jailbreaking.

An Android device is not able to be booted with a patched kernel. Custom firmware or access from the vendor is required to obtain administrator access.
