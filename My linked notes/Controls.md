[[security control]]

- Cybersecurity controls are the countermeasures that companies implement to detect, prevent, reduce, or counteract security risks

- Cybersecurity controls are **the processes your organization has in place to protect from dangerous network vulnerabilities and data hacks**

**A [[security control]] is something designed to give a system or data asset the properties of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation**. 
# Categories
- [[technical]] : the control is implemented as a system
- [[operational]] : the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems.
- [[managerial]] : the control gives oversight of the information system.



# CONTROL FUNCTIONAL TYPES

Security controls can also be classified in types according to the goal or function they perform:
- [[Preventive]]
- [[Detective]] : the control may not prevent or deter access, but it will **identify and record** any attempted or successful intrusion.
- [[Corrective]] : the control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event.
- [[Physical]]
- [[Deterrent]]
- [[Compensating]] : the control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.

Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented:

-   [[technical]] —the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.  
	-   Operate without much intervention once configured
-   [[operational]] —the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls.	
	-   Day-to-day administration of security system
	-   Tactical reporting and insights
	-   Controls that require people to implement or administer
	-   Standard operating procedures
-  [[managerial]] —the control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.
	- Oversight of the security system
	-   Strategic reporting and insights
	-   Risk assessment
	-   Security policies

## SECURITY CONTROL FUNCTIONAL TYPES

Security controls can also be classified in types according to the goal or function they perform:
#fleck 
-   ==Preventive==—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack can succeed. A preventative control operates before an attack can take place. Access control lists (ACL) configured on firewalls and file system objects are preventative-type controls. Anti-malware software also acts as a preventative control, by blocking processes identified as malicious from executing. Directives and standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be thought of as administrative versions of preventative controls.
	-   Reduce likelihood of attack
	-   Operate before/preceding an attack
	-   Examples include firewalls, anti-virus, encryption, ...
-   ==Detective==—the control may not prevent or deter access, but it will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion. A detective control operates during the progress of an attack. Logs provide one of the best examples of detective-type controls.
	-   Identify or log signs of attack
	-   Operate during an attack
	-   Examples include intrusion detection, log review, physical inspections, ...
-   ==Corrective==—the control acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event. A corrective control is used after an attack. A good example is a backup system that can restore data that was damaged during an intrusion. Another example is a patch management system that acts to eliminate the vulnerability exploited during the attack.
	-   Reduce or eliminate impact of attack
	-   Operate after/following an attack
	-   Examples include backup, patch management, lessons learned, ...

While most controls can be classed functionally as preventative, detective, or corrective, a few other types can be used to define other cases:

-   ==Physical==—controls such as alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, security cameras, and guards that deter and detect access to premises and hardware are often classed separately.
-   ==Deterrent==—the control may not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion. This could include signs and warnings of legal penalties against trespass or intrusion.
-   ==Compensating==—the control serves as a substitute for a principal control, as recommended by a security standard, and affords the same (or better) level of protection but uses a different methodology or technology.
