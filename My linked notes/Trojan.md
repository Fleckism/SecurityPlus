**Trojan**â€”malware concealed within an installer package for software that appears to be legitimate. **This type of malware does not seek any type of consent for installation and is actively designed to operate secretly**.
- Intellectual property theft
	- By using a keylogger

the [[Trojan]] may have to use a **registry entry or create itself as a service, which can usually be detected fairly easily.**

A [[rootkit]] is characterized by its ability to hide itself by changing core system files and programming interfaces and to escalate privileges. The gaming company accomplished this.  
Trojans cannot conceal their presence entirely and will surface as a running process or service. While a rootkit is a type of Trojan or spyware, it differs in its ability to hide itself.

Consequently, [[Trojan]]s installed in the same way as regular software cannot conceal their presence entirely and will show up as a running process or service. Often the process image name is configured to be similar to a genuine executable or library to avoid detection. For example, a Trojan may use the filename "run32d11" to masquerade as "run32dll". To ensure persistence (running when the computer is restarted), the [[Trojan]] may have to use a **registry entry or create itself as a service, which can usually be detected fairly easily.**
