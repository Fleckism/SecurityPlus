(**L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, **P**HP) The common set of system software and programming languages used in a Linux-based Web server. Known as a "tech stack" or "software stack," LAMP comprises the Linux operating system, Apache Web server software and MySQL database management system (DBMS). Applications are programmed in PHP, but also in the Perl and Python languages. A LAMP application is a non-Windows environment; however, there is a Windows equivalent: WAMP is Windows, Apache, MySQL and PHP.
