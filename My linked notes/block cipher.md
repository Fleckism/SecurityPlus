In a block cipher, if there is not enough data in the plaintext, it's padded to the correct size. Padding is not an issue with streaming, where each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time, but it is problematic in dealing with block size.

A block cipher is not suitable to communications, but a stream cipher is, since each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time.

Based on the value of the key used, a stream cipher is not subjected to complex transposition and substitution operations.

In a stream cipher, the plaintext is not divided into equal-size blocks.

Counter Mode (CTM) combines each block with a counter value. This allows each block to be processed individually and in parallel, improving performance.

Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode applies the same key to each plaintext block, which means identical plaintext blocks can output identical ciphertexts. This is not how a stream cipher behaves.

Counter Mode (CTM) allows block ciphers to behave like stream ciphers, which are faster than block ciphers.

Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode applies an Initialization Vector (IV) to the first plaintext block to ensure that the key produces a unique ciphertext from any given plaintext and repeating as a “chain.” This is not how a stream cipher behaves.
