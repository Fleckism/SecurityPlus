[[DNS]] Security Extensions (DNSSEC) help to **mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks by providing a validation process for DNS responses**. With DNSSEC enabled, the authoritative server for the zone creates a "package" of resource records (called an RRset) signed with a private key (the Zone Signing Key). When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can be used to verify the signature.
