Use ipconfig to check the IP addresses of the default gateway and the DHCP server. Use arp to check the MAC addresses associated with those IP addresses and investigate possible spoofing. You could also use the route command to verify the properties of the default route.

86

You suspect the rogue host is modifying traffic before forwarding it, with the side effect of increasing network latency. Which tool could you use to measure latency on traffic routed from this subnet?

From a Windows host, the pathping tool can be used to measure latency along a route.

87

What type of tool could you use to fingerprint the host acting as the default gateway?

This requires a tool that performs fingerprinting—service and version detection—by examining responses to network probes and comparing them to known responses from common platforms. Nmap is very widely used for this task, or you could use hping or Netcat.

88

You are investigating a Linux server that is the source of suspicious network traffic. At a terminal on the server, which tool could you use to check which process is using a given TCP port?

The _netstat_ command can assist, however, use the more favorable ss command-line utility tool that is faster and more human-readable.

89

Backup solutions mitigate risks from data loss, where files or information is deleted, corrupted, or otherwise destroyed. Backup does not mitigate risks from data breach, where confidential or private data is stolen (exfiltrated) and made public or sold for criminal profit. Mitigating risks of data breach requires effective secure processing, authorization, and authentication security controls.

132

A system integrator is offering a turnkey solution for customer contact data storage and engagement analytics using several cloud services. Does this solution present any supply chain risks beyond those of the system integrator's consulting company?

Yes, the system integrator is proposing the use of multiple vendors (the cloud service providers), with potentially complex issues for collecting, storing, and sharing customer personal data across these vendors.

Verify that the vulnerability feed/plug-in/test has been updated with the specific CVE that you need to test for.

139

You have configured a network vulnerability scanner for an engineering company. When running a scan, multiple sensors within an embedded systems network became unresponsive, causing a production shutdown. What alternative method of vulnerability scanning should be used for the embedded systems network?

A fully non-intrusive solution should be adopted, such as sniffing traffic using a network tap or mirror port. Using the network traffic to detect vulnerabilities rather than actively probing each device will not cause system stability issues (though there is greater risk of false positive and false negative results).

140

A vulnerability scan reports that a CVE associated with CentOS Linux is present on a host, but you have established that the host is not running CentOS. What type of scanning error event is this?

What are the additional challenges of meeting this request, given the lack of investment?

Collecting network traffic and log data from multiple sources and then analyzing it manually will require many hours of analyst time. The use of threat feeds and intelligence fusion to automate parts of this analysis effort would enable a much swifter response.

142

What term refers to assessment techniques that avoid alerting threat actors?

This can be referred to as maneuver.

A threat actor has no privileged information about the website configuration or security controls. This is simulated in a black box (or blind) pen test engagement.

153

You are agreeing a proposal to run a series of team-based exercises to test security controls under different scenarios. You propose using purple team testing, but the contracting company is only familiar with the concept of red and blue teams. What is the advantage of running a purple team exercise?

In a red versus blue team, there is no contact between the teams, and no opportunity to collaborate on improving security controls. In a purple team exercise, there is regular contact and knowledge sharing between the teams throughout the progression of the exercise.

154

Why should an Internet service provider (ISP) be informed before pen testing on a hosted website takes place?

ISPs monitor their networks for suspicious traffic and may block the test attempts. The pen test may also involve equipment owned and operated by the ISP.

155

What tools are used for OSINT?

Open-source intelligence is a reconnaissance activity to gather information about the target from any public source.

The help desk takes a call and the caller states that she cannot connect to the e-commerce website to check her order status. She would also like a user name and password. The user gives a valid customer company name but is not listed as a contact in the customer database. The user does not know the correct company code or customer ID. Is this likely to be a social engineering attempt, or is it a false alarm?

This is likely to be a social engineering attempt. The help desk should not give out any information or add an account without confirming the caller's identity.

Users at an organization frequent a site where browsing a list of products for purchase is possible. Lately, when visiting the site, an unrecognized window opens claiming that anti-malware software has detected files infected with viruses. Instructions in the window indicate the user should click a link to install software that will remove these infections. What type of attack has occurred?

This a watering hole attack, which is an attack in which an attacker targets specific groups or organizations, discovers which websites they frequent, and injects malicious code into those sites.

Your CEO calls to request market research data immediately be forwarded to her personal email address. You recognize her voice, but a proper request form has not been filled out, and use of third-party email is prohibited. She states that, normally, she would fill out the form and should not be an exception, but she urgently needs the data to prepare for a round table at a conference she is attending. What type of social engineering techniques could this use, or is it a false alarm?

This could be a social engineering use case where impersonation has occurred. A combination of spear phishing (attack using specific details) and vishing (attack over a voice channel) attacks were used by the impersonator. A type of voice mimicry technology may have been used to sound like the real CEO. A safe approach would be to contact the CEO back on a known mobile number to confirm the request.

A company that manages marketing data and private information for many high-profile clients hosts a public event for prospective employees. With the possibility of social engineering attacks in mind, what precautions should employees take when the guests are being shown around the office?
