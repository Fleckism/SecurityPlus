#tool As the name suggests, tcpreplay takes previously captured traffic that has been saved to a .pcap file and replays it through a network interface ([linux.die.net/man/1/tcpreplay](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tcpreplay)). Optionally, fields in the capture can be changed, such as substituting MAC or IP addresses. tcpreplay is useful for analysis purposes. If you have captured suspect traffic, you can replay it through a monitored network interface to test intrusion detection rules malicious traffic sample.
