Cryptography is **the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents**

One of the requirements of a strong cryptographic algorithm is to produce a disordered [[ciphertext]] ( aka high [[Entropy]]).

A single hash function, symmetric cipher, or asymmetric cipher is called a **cryptographic primitive.**

A complete [[cryptographic]] system or product is likely to use multiple cryptographic primitives, such as within a cipher suite. The properties of different symmetric/asymmetric/hash types and of specific ciphers for each type impose limitations on their use in different contexts and for different purposes.

**Cryptographic systems** will use both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. 

More generally, **cryptographic agility** refers to an organization's ability to update the specific algorithms used across a range of security products without affecting the business workflows that those products support
