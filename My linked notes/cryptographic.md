Cryptography is **the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents**
[[cryptography]]


A single hash function, symmetric cipher, or asymmetric cipher is called a **cryptographic primitive.**

A complete [[cryptographic]] system or product is likely to use multiple cryptographic primitives, such as within a cipher suite. The properties of different symmetric/asymmetric/hash types and of specific ciphers for each type impose limitations on their use in different contexts and for different purposes.

**Cryptographic systems** will use both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
