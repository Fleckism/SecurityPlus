A digital envelope is a type of key exchange system that utilizes symmetric encryption for speed and asymmetric encryption for convenience and security.

A digital certificate is an electronic document that associates credentials with a public key. This only involves asymmetric encryption.

Digital evidence or Electronically Stored Information (ESI) is evidence that cannot be seen with the naked eye; rather, it must be interpreted using a machine or process. There is no encryption involved.

A digital signature is a message digest encrypted with a user's private key. It uses only asymmetric encryption to prove the identity of the sender of a message and to show a message has not been tampered with.
