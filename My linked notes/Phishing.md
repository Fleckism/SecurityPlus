[[Phishing]] is a combination of [[social engineering]] and [[spoofing]]

+ Credential harvesting

It persuades or tricks the target into interacting with a malicious resource disguised as a trusted one, traditionally using email as the vector. A phishing message might try to convince the user to perform some action, such as installing disguised malware or allowing a remote access connection by the attacker. Other types of phishing campaign use a spoof website set up to imitate a bank or e‑commerce site or some other web resource that should be trusted by the target. The attacker then emails users of the genuine website informing them that their account must be updated or with some sort of [[hoax]] alert or alarm, supplying a disguised link that actually leads to the spoofed site. When the user authenticates with the spoofed site, their logon credentials are captured.
