 **man-in-the-middle**
 - When an attacker intercepts and modify communications.
	 - Prevented  by [[MAC]]
- Cryptographic attacks are used to try to intercept confidential data or to spoof cryptographic credentials, such as a digital certificate. Some of these attacks depend on capturing the communications between two parties. They do not break the cryptographic system but exploit vulnerabilities in the way it is used. A _man-in-the-middle (MITM)_ attack is typically focused on public key cryptography.
