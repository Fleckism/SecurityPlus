**certificate authority**
- A server that guarantees subject identities by issuing signed digital certificate wrappers for their public keys
The functions of a CA are as follows:
The certificate contains the 
- subject's **public key** and is signed by the 
- CA's **private key**
-   Provide a range of certificate services useful to the community of users serviced by the CA.
-   Ensure the validity of certificates and the identity of those applying for them (registration).
-   Establish trust in the CA by users and government and regulatory authorities and enterprises, such as financial institutions.
-   Manage the servers (repositories) that store and administer the certificates.
-   Perform key and certificate lifecycle management, notably revoking invalid certificates.

- In most cases, the subject generates a key pair then adds the public key along with subject information and certificate type in a certificate signing request ([[CSR]]) and submits it to the CA. If the CA accepts the request, it generates a certificate with the appropriate key usage and validity, signs it, and transmits it to the subject.
