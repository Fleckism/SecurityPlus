**Address Resolution Protocol**
Display the local machine's Address Resolution Protocol cache. The ARP cache shows the [[MAC address]] of the interface associated with each IP address the local host has communicated with recently. This can be useful if you are investigating a suspected spoofing attack. For example, a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack is where the MAC address of the default gateway IP listed in the cache is not the legitimate router's MAC address.
