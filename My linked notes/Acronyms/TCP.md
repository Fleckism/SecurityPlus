Steganography obscures the presence of a message and can be used to encode messages within TCP packet data fields to create a covert message channel for data exfiltration.

Homomorphic encryption is used to share privacy-sensitive data sets. It allows a recipient to perform statistical calculations on data fields while keeping the data set as a whole encrypted.

Blockchain uses cryptography to secure an expanding list of transactional records. Each record, or block, goes through a hash function. Each blockâ€™s hash value links to the hash value of the previous block.

Key stretching takes a key that is generated from a user password and repeatedly converts it to a longer and more random key, through thousands of rounds of hashing.
