remote access trojan(tool)

- Any type of access method to a host that circumvents the usual authentication method and gives the remote user administrative control can be referred to as a [[backdoor]]. A remote access trojan ([[RAT]]) is backdoor malware that mimics the functionality of legitimate remote control programs, but is designed specifically to **operate covertly**. Once the RAT is installed, it allows the threat actor to access the host, upload files, and install software or use "live off the land" techniques to effect further compromises.Â
