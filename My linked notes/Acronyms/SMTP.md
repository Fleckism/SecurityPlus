 **Simple Mail Transfer #protocol**
 - Standard email protocol on the Internet and part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. 
 - SMTP defines the format of an email message and the message transfer agent ([[MTA]]), which is a mail server that forwards the mail. The SMTP server temporarily stores the messages until they can be relayed to another server or to a message store that uses the POP3 or IMAP4 access protocol to communicate with the user's email program.
