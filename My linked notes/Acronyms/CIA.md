Secure information has **three** properties
- **In the following priority**
+ [[Confidentiality]]
+ [[Integrity]]
+ [[Availability]]
+ [[Non-repudiation]]: security models and researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit. The most important of these is non-repudiation. 

**Industrial processes also prioritize availability and integrity over confidentiality—reversing the CIA triad as the ==AIC== triad.**
