**cyber threat intelligence** 
- Where STIX provides the syntax for describing  [[CTI]], the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. For example, a CTI service provider would maintain a repository of CTI data. Subscribers to the service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII. This data can be requested by the client (referred to as a _collection_), or the data can be pushed to subscribers (referred to as a _channel_).
