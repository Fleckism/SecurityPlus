**indicator of compromise (IoC)**
-   Unauthorized software and files
-   Suspicious emails
-   Suspicious registry and file system changes
-   Unknown port and protocol usage
-   Excessive bandwidth usage
-   Rogue hardware
-   Service disruption and defacement
-   Suspicious or unauthorized account usage

An IoC can be definite and objectively identifiable, like a malware signature, but often IoCs can only be described with confidence via the correlation of many data points. Because these IoCs are often identified through patterns of anomalous activity rather than single events, they can be open to interpretation and therefore slow to diagnose. Consequently, threat intelligence platforms use AI-backed analysis to speed up detection without overwhelming analysts' time with false positives.

Strictly speaking, an [[IoC]] is evidence of an attack that was successful. The term **indicator of attack (IoA)** is sometimes also used for evidence of an intrusion **attempt in progress**.

Put another way, an IoC is evidence of a [[TTPs]].
