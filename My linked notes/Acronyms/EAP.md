**Extensible Authentication #protocol**  (EAP)
- provides a **framework** for deploying multiple types of authentication protocols and technologies. EAP allows lots of different [[authentication]] methods, but many of them use a 
- **digital certificate** on the server and/or client machines. This allows the machines to establish a trust relationship and create a secure tunnel to transmit the user credential or to perform smart-card authentication without a user password.
- Where EAP provides the authentication mechanisms, the IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control ([[NAC]]) protocol provides the means of using an EAP method when a device connects to an Ethernet switch port, wireless access point (with enterprise authentication configured), or VPN gateway. 802.1X uses authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture #A_D
- Some EAP support smart cards or machine authentication
