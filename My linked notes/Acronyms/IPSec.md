**Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)**
operates at the **network layer (layer 3)** of the [[OSI]] model, so it can be implemented without having to configure specific application support. IPSec can provide both **confidentiality (by encrypting data packets)** and[[ [[integrity]]/anti-replay]] (by signing each packet). The main drawback is that it adds overhead to data communications. IPSec can be used to secure communications on local networks and as a remote access protocol.
