Elliptic curve cryptography
- More secure than [[RSA]]
- trap door function , because it is easy to perform using the public key, but difficult to reverse without knowing the private key.
- **256** bits is very approximately comparable to RSA with a key size of 2048 bits.Â 

ECC depends on the **discrete logarithm** problem.
