a phishing attack conducted through a **voice channel (telephone or VoIP, for instance)**. For example, targets could be called by someone purporting to represent their bank asking them to verify a recent credit card transaction and requesting their security details. It can be much more difficult for someone to refuse a request made in a phone call compared to one made in an email.
