In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **load balancing** refers to the process of distributing a set of [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(computing) "Task (computing)") over a set of [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_resource "System resource") (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.

Load balancing is the subject of research in the field of [parallel computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computers "Parallel computers"). Two main approaches exist: static algorithms, which do not take into account the state of the different machines, and dynamic algorithms, which are usually more general and more efficient but require exchanges of information between the different computing units, at the risk of a loss of efficiency.

- distribute traffic between network segments or servers to optimize performance. Load balancers can work at layer 4 of the OSI model or higher.
