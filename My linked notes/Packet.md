a **network packet** is a formatted unit of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)") carried by a [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network "Packet-switched network"). A packet consists of control information and user data;[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet#cite_note-1) the latter is also known as the _[payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing) "Payload (computing)")_. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address"), [error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection "Error detection") codes, or sequencing information). Typically, control information is found in packet [headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing) "Header (computing)") and [trailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(computing) "Trailer (computing)").
