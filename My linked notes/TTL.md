-   Layer 4 load balancer—basic load balancers make forwarding decisions on IP address and TCP/UDP port values, working at the transport layer of the OSI model.
-   Layer 7 load balancer (content switch)—as web applications have become more complex, modern load balancers need to be able to make forwarding decisions based on application-level data, such as a request for a particular URL or data types like video or audio streaming. This requires more complex logic, but the processing power of modern appliances is sufficient to deal with this. 

- Layer 4 load balancers can only make basic connectivity tests while layer 7 appliances can test the application's state, as opposed to only verifying host availability.

Is a load balancer hardware or software?
**Its an appliance** I think it is both hardware and software.
