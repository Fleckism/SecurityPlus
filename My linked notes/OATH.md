The Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) is an industry body established with the aim of developing an open, strong authentication framework. _Open_ means a system that any enterprise can link into to perform authentication of users and devices across different networks. **_Strong_ means that the system is based not just on passwords, but also on 2- or 3-factor authentication or on 2-step verification.** OATH has developed two algorithms for implementing one time passwords ([[OTPs]]).
