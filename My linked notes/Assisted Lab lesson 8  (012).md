## Assisted Lab 12: Configuring a System for Auditing Policies

## Scenario

In this activity, you will display processes running on the server, confirm applied Group Policy Objects, and then use Group Policy Objects to configure auditing.

## Objectives

This activity is designed to test your understanding of and ability to apply content examples in the following CompTIA Security+ objectives:

-   3.7 Given a scenario, implement identity and account management controls.


## Browse running processes

There are many ways of viewing security-oriented information on the system. One aspect of malicious software mitigation is process management. Use the Sysinternals Process Explorer tool ([docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals)) to view which accounts are running processes.

1.  On the [DC1](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/10c81be6-b086-4386-973a-9fb9e7936295?rc=10#) VM, send [Ctrl+Alt+Delete](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/10c81be6-b086-4386-973a-9fb9e7936295?rc=10#) and sign in as 515support\Administrator with the password 
    
2.  Open File Explorer and browse to C:\LABFILES\Sysinternals.
    
3.  Right-click **procexp64.exe** and select **Run as administrator**. Select **Yes** at the UAC prompt.
    
    In the output, you can see the hierarchy of processes and the various containers for user-mode processes. Kernel processes and critical services are run by SYSTEM whereas less-privileged services are run by either the LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE accounts. User-initiated processes and services are run by the named account (515support\Administrator in the example).
    
    Process Explorer![Process Explorer tool](https://labondemand.blob.core.windows.net/content/lab84046/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-07%20at%203.14.03%20PM.png)
    
    > Try to spend time observing Process Explorer on different Windows systems with different applications and servers running. Understanding what should be running is critical to identifying what shouldn't.
    
4.  Close the Process Explorer window. Minimize the File Explorer window.
    
    One of the key points to understand is that any malware that gets executed on this machine will run with at least the privileges of the logged-on user, and as the current user is a domain administrator, that's quite a lot of privileges.
    
5.  From the **Start** menu, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then select **Run as Administrator**. Select **Yes** to confirm the UAC prompt.
    
6.  Enter the following command to generate similar information:
    
    ```
    tasklist
    ```
    
    As most systems run a large number of processes, it is common to run tasklist with filters.
    
7.  Run the tasklist command again, and this time filter for running services. Redirect the output of the command to a text file named C:\services-running.txt.
    
    ```
    tasklist /SVC /FI "STATUS eq RUNNING" > C:\services-running.txt
    ```
    
8.  Does the C:\services-running.txt file exist?
    
    > Many of your tasks are scored by scripts. You must use the same names and other labels as the lab instructions specify or your task may be marked as incorrect. For example, if the task says to create a user account named “user01,” than “user1” would be marked as incorrect.
