The _principle of consensus_ or _social proof_ refers to the fact that without an explicit instruction to behave in a certain way, many people will act just as they think others would act. A social engineering attack can use this instinct either to persuade the target that to refuse a request would be odd ("That's not something anyone else has ever said no to") or to exploit polite behavior to slip into a building while someone holds the door for them. As another example, an attacker may be able to fool a user into believing that a malicious website is actually legitimate by posting numerous fake reviews and testimonials praising the site. The victim, believing many different people have judged the site acceptable, takes this as evidence of the site's legitimacy and places their trust in it.
