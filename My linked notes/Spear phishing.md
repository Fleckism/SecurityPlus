aÂ phishing scam where the attacker has some information that makes an individual target more likely to be fooled by the attack. Each phishing message is tailored to address a specific target user. The attacker might know the name of a document that the target is editing, for instance, and send a malicious copy, or the phishing email might show that the attacker knows the recipient's full name, job title, telephone number, or other details that help convince the target that the communication is genuine.
