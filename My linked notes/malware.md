Malware is usually simply defined as software that does something bad, from the perspective of the system owner. 

 not classified in a rigorous way, so some definitions overlap or are blurred. 

 **Types of malware according to [[vector]]**:
-  [[Virus]]es 
-  [[worm]]s
-  [[Trojan]]
-  [[PUPs]]
-  [[PUAs]]

**Other classifications are based on the [[payload]]**. delivered by the malware. 

 [[Fileless]] is not a definitive classification, but it describes a collection of common behaviors and techniques:
 
 [[Ransomware]] is a type of malware that tries to extort money from the victim
  
 If malware is designed to operate covertly, indicators can require detailed analysis of process, file system, and network behavior.
 
 Resource Consumption: Also, it is only really poorly written malware or malware that performs intensive operations ([[botnet]] [[DDoS]], [[cryptojacking]], and [[cryptoransomware]], for instance) that displays this behavior. Resource consumption could be a reason to investigate a system rather than definitive proof of infection
 
 Even if the [[malware]] code is not saved to disk, the malware is still likely to **interact with the file system and registry, revealing its presence by behavior.** A computer's file system stores a great deal of useful metadata about when files were created, accessed, or modified. Analyzing these metadata and **checking for suspicious temporary files** can help you establish your timeline of events for an incident that has left traces on a host and its files.
 
 Because shellcode is easy to obfuscate, it can often evade signature-based [[A-V]] products. Threat hunting and security monitoring must use **behavioral-based techniques** to identify infections. This means close analysis of the processes running in system memory on a host. To perform abnormal process behavior analysis effectively, you should build up a sense of what is "normal" in a system and spot deviations in a potentially infected system.
 
 **Along with observing how a process interacts with the file system, network activity is one of the most reliable ways to identify malware.**
 
 [[Fileless]] 
 [[logic bomb]]
 [[PUPs]]
 [[Trojan]]
 [[virus]]
 [[worm]]
 
  Some malware classifications, such as Trojan, virus, and worm, focus on the [[vector]] used by the malware. The **vector is the method by which the malware executes on a computer and potentially spreads to other network hosts**

  # SPYWARE AND KEYLOGGERS
[[spyware]]
The first viruses and worms focused on the destructive potential of being able to replicate. As the profitable uses of this software became apparent, however, they started to be coded with payloads designed to facilitate intrusion, fraud, and data theft. Various types of unwanted code and malware perform some level of monitoring:

In Windows, [[malware]] can only be manually installed with local administrator privileges. This means the user must be confident enough in the installer package to enter the credentials or accept the User Account Control ([[UAC]]) prompt
