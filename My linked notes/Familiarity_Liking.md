Some people have the sort of natural charisma that allows them to persuade others to do as they request. One of the basic tools of a social engineer is simply to be affable and likable, and to present the requests they make as completely reasonable and unobjectionable. This approach is relatively low-risk as even if the request is refused, it is less likely to cause suspicion and the social engineer may be able to move on to a different target without being detected.
