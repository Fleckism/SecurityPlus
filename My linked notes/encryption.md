	- Encryption is use to transform data to keep it **secret**
- [[AES]]
- [[Homomorphic encryption]]
- **Symmetric encryption: Confidentiality**â€”symmetric ciphers are generally fast and well suited to bulk encrypting large amounts of data.

Encryption supporting [[confidentiality]] is used for both 
- data-at-rest (file encryption) [[asymmetric]]
- data-in-transit (transport encryption):[[asymmetric]]

 [[Add data for symmetric ]]
Keyboard encryption software is used to protect against keyloggers, which record keystrokes for the purpose of stealing data. Keyloggers are spyware.
