A network segment is one where all the hosts attached to the segment can use local (layer 2) forwarding to communicate freely with one another. The hosts are said to be within the same broadcast domain. Segregation means that the hosts in one segment are restricted in the way they communicate with hosts in other segments. They might only be able to communicate over certain network ports, for instance.
