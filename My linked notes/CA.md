The functions of a CA are as follows:
-   Provide a range of certificate services useful to the community of users serviced by the CA.
-   Ensure the validity of certificates and the identity of those applying for them (registration).
-   Establish trust in the CA by users and government and regulatory authorities and enterprises, such as financial institutions.
-   Manage the servers (repositories) that store and administer the certificates.
-   Perform key and certificate lifecycle management, notably revoking invalid certificates.
