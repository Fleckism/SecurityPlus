A network directory lists the subjects (principally users, computers, and services) and objects (such as directories and files) available on the network plus the permissions that subjects have over objects. A network directory facilitates authentication and authorization, and it is critical that it be maintained as a highly secure service. Most directory services are based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ([[LDAP]]), running over [[port]] 389. The basic protocol provides no security and all transmissions are in plaintext, making it vulnerable to sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks([[MITM]]). Authentication (referred to as **binding to the server**) can be implemented in the following ways:

-   **No authentication**—anonymous access is granted to the directory.
-   **Simple bind**—the client must supply its distinguished name ([[DN]]) and password, but these are passed as **plaintext**.
-   **Simple Authentication and Security Layer** (SASL)—the client and server negotiate the use of a supported authentication mechanism, such as Kerberos. The STARTTLS command can be used to require encryption (sealing) and message integrity (signing). This is the preferred mechanism for Microsoft's Active Directory ([[AD]]) implementation of LDAP.
-   LDAP Secure ([[LDAPS]])—the server is installed with a digital certificate, which it uses to set up a [[secure tunnel]] for the user credential exchange. LDAPS uses [[port]] 636.

If secure access is required, anonymous and simple authentication access methods should be disabled on the server.

Generally two levels of access will need to be granted on the directory: **read-only access (query)** and **read/write access (update)**. This is implemented using an access control policy, but the precise mechanism is vendor-specific and not specified by the LDAP standards documentation.

Unless hosting a public service, the [[LDAP]] directory server should also only be accessible from the private network. This means that the **LDAP port should be blocked by a firewall** from access over the public interface. If there is integration with other services over the Internet, ideally only authorized IPs should be permitted.
