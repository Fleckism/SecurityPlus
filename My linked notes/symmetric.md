- **symmetric [[cipher]] is one in which encryption and decryption are both performed by the same secret key**
- Provides [[Confidentiality]] **<---**
- 1 key, aka private key
- keys 128 bits or 256 bits
- Easily encrypted using a public key
- Bulk [[encryption]] (aka large amounts of data)
- **symmetric algorithms** do not provide message i**ntegrity or authentication.**

>Consequently, [[asymmetric]] encryption is mostly used for [[authentication]] and [[non-repudiation]] and for **key agreement and exchange**. Key agreement/exchange refers to settling on a secret **symmetric** key to use for bulk encryption without anyone else discovering it.
==Does this mean that a symmetric key is transferred asymmetrically?==
