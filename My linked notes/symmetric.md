**symmetric cipher is one in which encryption and decryption are both performed by the same secret key**.

Consequently, [[asymmetric]] encryption is mostly used for authentication and non-repudiation and for **key agreement and exchange**. Key agreement/exchange refers to settling on a secret **symmetric** key to use for bulk encryption without anyone else discovering it.
