(**N**ear **F**ield **C**ommunication) NFC is a wireless technology with a very short range that is built into most new smartphones and credit cards, and it may be included in tablets, cameras and household appliances. NFC is used for identification, mobile payments, train and bus tickets and other transactions. It can also be used to transfer data between devices, as well as connect a new wireless device to a Wi-Fi hotspot (see [Wi-Fi Protected Setup](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/wi-fi-protected-setup)).

**NFC Is an RFID Technology**

Like an RFID tag, an NFC tag stores data. For example, when embedded in an employee badge brought close to a reader, the person is identified. When users make payments with a chip-based credit card, they are using NFC (see [EMV](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/emv)). An NFC tag can also be used like a QR barcode to retrieve a Web page or other information (see [NFC tags vs. QR codes](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/nfc-tags-vs-qr-codes)).

NFC is based on the same magnetic field induction used in RFID. However, whereas RFID is unidirectional, NFC can be bidirectional. RFID chips can also be read at a distance, but the 13.56 MHz NFC channel range is merely an inch or two. Adhering to the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard for smart cards, NFC is compatible with terminals in use around the world.

**Back to Back**

Two NFC Android smartphones transfer data just by bringing them in close contact. See [Android Beam](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/android-beam).

**Wi-Fi Off, Bluetooth On**

Pasted on the car's phone holder, this TAGZ-brand NFC sticker was programmed by an app to turn Wi-Fi off and Bluetooth on when the phone comes in contact with it. See [NFC sticker](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/nfc-sticker).

**The Contactless Logo**

The NFC contactless logo is printed on the back of credit cards that have an EMV chip. To confirm the transaction, the card is tapped against the payment terminal. See [EMV](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/emv).

**NFC and More**

Modern smartphones have five wireless radios. Windows and BlackBerry 10 phones are no longer made; however, some are still functioning for users who love them. See [Windows Phone](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/windows-phone) and [BlackBerry 10](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/blackberry-10).
