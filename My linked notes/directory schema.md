Directory schema describes the types of attributes, what information they contain, and the way object types are defined through attributes (some of which may be required, and some optional). Some of the attributes commonly used include 
- common name ([[CN]]), 
- organizational unit ([[OU]]), 
- organization (O), 
- country (C), and 
- domain component (DC). 

For example, the distinguished name of a web server operated by Widget in the UK might be:

CN=WIDGETWEB, OU=Marketing, O=Widget, C=UK, DC=widget, DC=foo
