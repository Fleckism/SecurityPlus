A company technician goes on vacation. While the technician is away, a critical patch released for Windows servers is not applied. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), what does the delay in applying the patch create on the server?

4.  Vulnerability

Solution

NIST defines vulnerability as a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach. In addition to delays in applying patches, other examples of vulnerabilities include improperly installed hardware, untested software, and inadequate physical security.

  
Control is a system or procedure put in place to mitigate a risk. An example of control is policies or network monitoring to identify unauthorized software.

  
Risk is the likelihood and impact of a threat actor exercising a vulnerability.

  
Threat is the potential for a threat agent to exercise a vulnerability.

When exploring the deep web, a user will need which of the following to find a specific and hidden dark web site?

3.  A specific URL or ip


Solution

Access to deep web sites, especially those hidden from search engines, are accessed via the website's URL. These are often only available via "word of mouth" bulletin boards.

The Onion Router (TOR) is software used to establish a network overlay to the Internet infrastructure to create the dark net. TOR, along with other software like Freenet or I2P, anonymizes the usage of the dark net.

A dark web search engine can be used to find dark web website collections, which constitute roughly 1% of the deep web. Some dark web websites have hidden IP addresses and cannot be found by search engines or require additional software to gain access to the site.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is cybersecurity-relevant information harvested from public websites and data records.

Which of the following is mostly considered an insider threat? **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  Former employee
2.  Contractor

Solution

Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. In this example, a former employee and a contractor fit the criteria.

Current employees, business partners, and contractors also qualify as insider threats.

A customer does not have authorized access and is unlikely to be affiliated with an organization’s staff.

A white hat hacker is given complete access to information about the network, which is useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider threat, but they are not an insider threat.
# 4
One aspect of threat modeling is to identify potential threat actors and the risks associated with each one. When assessing the risk that any one type of threat actor poses to an organization, what are the critical factors to profile? **(Select all that apply.)**

3.  Intent
4.  Motivation

Solution

From the choices provided, the two most critical factors to profile for a threat actor are intent and motivation. Greed, curiosity, or grievance may motivate an attacker.

The intent could be to vandalize and disrupt a system or to steal something.

While education and socioeconomic traits could potentially be considered in a threat actor profile, they are inferior to intent and motivation.

Malicious intents and motivations can be contrasted with accidental or unintentional threat actors and agents. Unintentional threat actors represent accidents, oversights, and other mistakes. In this sense, training is crucial to ensuring employees are educated about security measures.

An unknowing user with authorized access to systems in a software development firm installs a seemingly harmless, yet unauthorized program on a workstation without the IT department's sanction. Identify the type of threat that is a result of this user's action.

1.  Unintentional insider threat

Solution

Anyone who has or had authorized access to an organization’s network, system, or data is considered an insider threat. Installing unauthorized software is negligent, but the user is an unintentional attack vector.

A malicious insider intentionally exceeds or misuses his or her access for purposes of sabotage, financial gain, or business advancement.

An attack vector is the path through which a threat actor gains access to a secure system; in this case, the path is through an employee's negligent software installation, which in all likelihood is not intentional.

An external threat with insider knowledge usually refers to former insiders, such as ex-employees now working at another company or who have been dismissed and now harbor a grievance. This is not the case with this situation.

# 6
A contractor has been hired to conduct security reconnaissance on a company. The contractor browses the company's website to identify employees and then finds their Facebook pages. Posts found on Facebook indicate a favorite bar that employees frequent. The contractor visits the bar and learns details of the company's security infrastructure through small talk. What reconnaissance phase techniques does the contractor practice? **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
3.  Social engineering

Solution

OSINT refers to using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. The contractor used this technique by identifying employees and the local restaurant they go to after work.

Social engineering was used at the restaurant by learning about the vacant positions and the shortfall in information security. This could be successful due to the attacker being charismatic and also social norms of people wanting to be friendly. The scenario also mentioned it was the popular location for after work drinks, meaning that alcohol was also likely involved.

Scanning would be conducted if the contractor used software tools to obtain the information.

Persistence refers to the tester's ability to reconnect to a compromised host.

What is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

3.  Using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target

Solution

OSINT is using web search tools and social media to obtain information about the target. It requires almost no privileged access as it relies on finding information that the company makes publicly available, whether intentionally or not.

Obtaining information, physical access to premises, or access to a user account through the art of persuasion is social engineering.

The means the organization will take to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of sensitive data and resources is considered a security policy.

Using software tools to obtain information about a host or network topology is considered scanning.
# 8
A security engineer investigates a recent system breach. When compiling a report of the incident, how does the engineer classify the actor and the vector?

1.  Threat

Solution

A threat is the potential for something to exploit a vulnerability. The thing that poses the threat is called an actor, while the path used can be referred to as the vector.

A vulnerability is a weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.

Risk is the likelihood and impact (or consequence) of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.

An exploit is a method that is used to expose and compromise a vulnerability.

An IT manager in the aviation sector checks the industry's threat intelligence feed to keep up on the latest threats and ensure the work center implements the best practices in the field. What type of threat intelligence source is the IT manager most likely accessing?


2.  An Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)

Solution

ISACs are set up to share industry-specific threat intelligence and best practices in critical sectors, such as the aviation industry.

OSINT includes any publicly available intelligence, in addition to threat intelligence services companies operate on an open source basis.

Vendors often post proprietary intelligence on their websites and blogs, free of cost, as a general benefit to their consumers.

Proprietary or closed threat intelligence platforms operate on a paid subscription basis. The security solution provider will also make the most valuable research available early to platform subscribers in the form of blogs, white papers, and webinars.

A Department of Defense (DoD) security team identifies a data breach in progress, based on some anomalous log entries, and take steps to remedy the breach and harden their systems. When they resolve the breach, they want to publish the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) securely, using standardized language for other government agencies to use. The team will transmit threat data feed via which protocol?

3.  Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)


Solution

The TAXII protocol provides a means for transmitting CTI data between servers and clients. Subscribers to the CTI service obtain updates to the data to load into analysis tools over TAXII.

While STIX provides the syntax for describing CTI, the TAXII protocol transmits CTI data between servers and clients.

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) is especially aimed at Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), but private companies can join too. AIS is based on the STIX and TAXII standards and protocols.

A file/code repository holds signatures of known malware code.
