Port scanning is difficult to conceal from detection systems, unless it is performed slowly and results are gathered over an extended period. Another option is to disguise the source of probes. To that end, scanless is a tool that uses third-party sites ([github.com/vesche/scanless](https://github.com/vesche/scanless)). This sort of tool is also useful in a defensive sense, by scanning for ports and services that are openÂ but shouldn't be.
