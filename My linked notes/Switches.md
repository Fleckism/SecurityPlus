forward frames between nodes in a cabled network. Switches work at layer 2 and 3 of the OSI model_._ At layer 2 they make forwarding decisions based on the hardware or [[MAC address |Media Access Control (MAC)]] address of attached nodes. Switches can establish network segments that either map directly to the underlying cabling or logical segments, created in the switch configuration as  virtual LANs ([[VLANs]]).
