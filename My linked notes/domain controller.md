A **domain controller** (**DC**) is a [[server]] computer that responds to security [[authentication]] requests within a computer network domain. It is a network server that is responsible for allowing host access to domain resources. It authenticates users, stores user account information and enforces [security policy]for a domain. It is most commonly implemented in [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") environments (see [Domain controller (Windows)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_controller_(Windows) "Domain controller (Windows)")), where it is the centerpiece of the Windows [Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory "Active Directory") service. However, non-Windows domain controllers can be established via [identity management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management "Identity management") software such as [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software) "Samba (software)") and [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") [FreeIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeIPA "FreeIPA").

**(1)** (**P**rimary **D**omain **C**ontroller) A service in a Windows server that manages security for its local domain. Every domain has one PDC, which contains a database of usernames, passwords and permissions. The PDC also provides a time service for the network and typically obtains the time from an edge router, which gets its time from the Internet. See [domain-based network](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/domain-based-network) and [BDC](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/bdc).

**(2)** (**P**ersonal **D**igital **C**ommunications) A digital cellular phone system widely used in Japan. Based on TDMA, it transmits in the 810-826 MHz and 1477-1501 MHz bands. PDC is a 2G wireless system. See [cellular generations](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/cellular-generations) and [PHS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/phs).

(**B**ackup **D**omain **C**ontroller) In a Windows server, a copy of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC). The BDC is periodically synchronized with the PDC.
