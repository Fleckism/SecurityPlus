Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to: 
- identify hosts, 
- network topology, and 
- open services/ports, establishing an overall attack surface.

 Reconnaissance is a type of assessment activity that maps the potential attack surface by identifying the nodes and connections that make up the network. You will often need to run scans using both command line and GUI topology discovery tools. You will need to report host configurations using [[fingerprinting]] tools and capture and analyze network traffic. You should also understand how tools can be used to operate backdoor connections to a host and to covertly exfiltrate data.
