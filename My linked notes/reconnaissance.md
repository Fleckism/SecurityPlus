There are multiple techniques used in **reconnaissance**

### Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to: 
- Mapping the attack surface
- identify hosts, 
- network topology, and 
- open services/ports, establishing an overall attack surface.
-  type of assessment activity
- maps the potential attack surface by identifying the nodes and connections that make up the network
-  **host** configurations using [[fingerprinting]] tools and capture and analyze network traffic.
- Passive types
- Active types

From a penetration tester or threat actor perspective, 
==network reconnaissance== will typically aim to discover the following:
-   Default gateway (the router connecting the subnet to other networks).
-   DNS server (used to resolve host names on the network).
-   Whether any network directory/authentication and application servers are present.
-   Whether any host/client access devices are present.
-   Whether any other types of devices (embedded systems or appliances) are present.

**Network reconnaissance... is it the same as Evaluate attack surface**
### [[Fingerprinting]] 
Host discovery scan vs 
- service configuration discovery:  
	- OS
	- Network services
	- Application software

You should also understand how tools can be used to operate backdoor connections to a host and to covertly exfiltrate data.
