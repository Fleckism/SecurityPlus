There are multiple techniques used in **reconnaissance**

### Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to: 
- Mapping the attack surface
- identify hosts, 
- network topology, and 
- open services/ports, establishing an overall attack surface.
-  type of assessment activity
- maps the potential attack surface by identifying the nodes and connections that make up the network
-  **host** configurations using [[fingerprinting]] tools and capture and analyze network traffic.
- Passive types
- Active types

**Network reconnaissance... is it the same as Evaluate attack surface**
### [[Fingerprinting]] 
Host discovery scan vs 
- service configuration discovery:  
	- OS
	- Network services
	- Application software

You should also understand how tools can be used to operate backdoor connections to a host and to covertly exfiltrate data.
