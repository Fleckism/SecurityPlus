**Attack** is an deliberate unauthorized action on a system or asset.
- Attack can be classified as active and passive attack.
- An attack will have a motive and will follow a method when opportunity arise.

**Attack surface** is all the points at which a malicious threat actor could try to exploit a vulnerability.


From the point-of-view of the threat actor, different parts of the **attack surface** represent potential attack vectors. **An attack vector is the path that a threat actor uses to gain access to a secure system**. In the majority of cases, gaining access means being able to run malicious code on the target.

-   Direct access—this is a type of physical or local attack. 
-   Removable media—the attacker conceals malware on a USB thumb drive or memory card.
-   Email—the attacker sends a malicious file attachment via email, or via any other communications system that allows attachments. The attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to persuade or trick the user into opening the attachment.
-   Remote and wireless—the attacker either obtains credentials for a remote access or wireless connection to the network or cracks the security protocols used for authentication. .
-   Supply chain—rather than attack the target directly, a threat actor may seek ways to infiltrate it via companies in its supply chain.
-   Web and social media—malware may be concealed in files attached to posts or presented as downloads. An attacker may also be able to compromise a site so that it automatically infects vulnerable browser software (a drive-by download). Social media may also be used more subtly, to reinforce a social engineering campaign and drive the adoption of Trojans.
-   Cloud—many companies now run part or all of their network services via Internet-accessible clouds. The attacker only needs to find one account, service, or host with weak credentials to gain access. The attacker is likely to target the accounts used to develop services in the cloud or manage cloud systems. They may also try to attack the cloud service provider (CSP) as a way of accessing the victim system.
