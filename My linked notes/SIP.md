The Session Initiation Protocol ([[SIP]]) 
is one of the most widely used session control protocols. SIP endpoints are the end-user devices (also known as user-agents), such as IP-enabled handsets or client and server web conference software. Each device, conference, or telephony user is assigned a unique SIP address known as a SIP Uniform Resource Indicator (URI), such as sip:bob.dobbs@comptia.org
