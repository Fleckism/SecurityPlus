 **vulnerability assessment, threat hunting, and penetration testing**
 
 Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can use passive or active reconnaissance techniques. A passive approach tries to discover issues without causing an impact to systems, whereas an active approach may cause instability on a scanned system
 
 **Vulnerability scanning by eavesdropping is passive, while penetration testing with credentials is active.**
 
 Reconnaissance is a type of assessment activity that maps the potential attack surface by identifying the nodes and connections that make up the network. You will often need to run scans using both command line and GUI topology discovery tools. You will need to report host configurations using fingerprinting tools and capture and analyze network traffic. You should also understand how tools can be used to operate backdoor connections to a host and to covertly exfiltrate data.
