Encryption algorithms protect data when it is stored on disk or transferred over a network. Encrypted data should only be accessible to someone with the correct decryption key. Weak encryption [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] allow unauthorized access to data. Such [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] arise in the following circumstances:

-   The key is generated from a simple password, making it vulnerable to guessing attempts by brute-force [[enumeration]] (if the password is too short) or dictionary enumeration (if the password is not complex).
-   The algorithm or cipher used for encryption has known weaknesses that allow brute-force enumeration.
-   The key is not distributed securely and can easily fall into the hands of people who are not authorized to decrypt the data.
