Which situation would require keyboard encryption software be installed on a computer?

1.  To set up single sign-on privileges
2.  To comply with input validation practices
3.  For the purpose of key management
4.  To protect against spyware

Solution

Keyboard encryption software is used to protect against keyloggers, which record keystrokes for the purpose of stealing data. Keyloggers are spyware.

Single sign-on is a technology that enables a user to authenticate once and receive authorizations for multiple services. It does not require keyboard encryption.

Input validation involves limiting the type of data a user can enter into specific fields, such as not allowing special characters in a user name field. Encryption is not a concern.

Key management is the process of administering cryptographic keys and is performed by a Certificate Authority. It is not applicable to keyboard encryption.

An employee calls IT personnel and states that they received an email with a PDF document to review. After the PDF was opened, the system has not been performing correctly. An IT admin conducted a scan and found a virus. Determine the two classes of viruses the computer most likely has. **(Select all that apply.)**

1.  Boot sector
2.  Program
3.  Script
4.  Trojan

Solution

**Both a program and script virus can use a PDF as a vector. The user stated that a PDF file was recently opened. A program virus is executed when an application is executed. Executable objects can also be embedded or attached within other file types such as Microsoft Word and Rich Text Format.**

A script virus typically targets vulnerabilities in an interpreter. Scripts are powerful languages used to automate operating system functions and add interactivity to web pages and are executed by an interpreter rather than self-executing. PDF documents have become a popular vector for script viruses.

A boot sector virus is one that attacks the disk boot sector information, the partition table, and sometimes the file system.

A trojan is a type of virus that infiltrates a system and creates a vector for other viruses or attackers to get into the system.

A gaming company decides to add software on each title it releases. The company's objective is to require the CD to be inserted during use. This software will gain administrative rights, change system files, and hide from detection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Consider the malware characteristics and determine which is being used.  (Select all that apply)

1.  Spyware
2.  Keylogger
3.  Rootkit
4.  Trojan

Solution

A [[rootkit]] is characterized by its ability to hide itself by changing core system files and programming interfaces and to escalate privileges. The gaming company accomplished this.  
Trojans cannot conceal their presence entirely and will surface as a running process or service. While a rootkit is a type of Trojan or spyware, it differs in its ability to hide itself.  
Spyware monitors user activity and may be installed with or without the user's knowledge, but it cannot gain administrative privileges or hide itself.  
A keylogger is also a type of spyware that records a user’s keystrokes. It occurs without a user’s knowledge, but it cannot hide itself or gain privileges.
