Protocol analyzers are also called sniffers. They intercept network traffic and allow an administrator or a hacker to view packet data. Data cannot be read if it's encrypted. The ability to see the traffic on the network should not be underestimated, especially during instances of troubleshooting and locating potentially malicious activity. It enables a view of the streaming traffic in real time, which is not offered by many switches or routers unless they are high-end. Items such as plaintext passwords being transmitted over the network, potential sources of flood attacks, and more can be discovered.
