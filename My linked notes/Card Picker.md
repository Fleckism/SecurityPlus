You are investigating a client workstation that has not obtained updates to its endpoint protection software for days. On the workstation you discover thousands of executable files with random names. The local endpoint log reveals that all of them have been scanned and identified as malware. You can find no evidence of any further intrusion on the network. What is the likely motive of the threat actor?

- This could be an offline tainted data attack against the endpoint software's identification engine.

What countermeasures can you use against the threat of malicious firmware code?
- Only use reputable suppliers for peripheral devices and strictly controlled sources for firmware updates. Consider use of a sheep dip sandboxed system to observe a device before allowing it to be attached to a host in the enterprise network. Use execution control software to allow only approved USB vendors.

- Password guessing software can attempt to crack captured hashes of user credentials by running through all possible combinations (brute force). This can be made less computationally intensive by using a dictionary of standard words or phrases.

When using S/MIME, which key is used to encrypt a message?
- The recipient's public key (principally). The public key is used to encrypt a symmetric session key and (for performance reasons) the session key does the actual data encoding. The session key and, therefore, the message text can then only be recovered by the recipient, who uses the linked private key to decrypt it.


True or false? A virtual IP is a means by which two appliances can be put in a fault tolerant configuration to respond to requests for the same IP address?

What areas of a business or workflow must you examine to assess multiparty risk?
- You need to examine supply chain dependencies to identify how problems with one or more suppliers would impact your business. You also need to examine customer relationships to determine what liabilities you have in the event of an incident impacting your ability to supply a product or service and what impact disruption of important customer accounts would have, should cyber incidents disrupt their business.

What are the properties of a public/private key pair?
- Each key can reverse the cryptographic operation performed by its pair but cannot reverse an operation performed by itself. The private key must be kept secret by the owner, but the public key is designed to be widely distributed. The private key cannot be determined from the public key, given a sufficient key size.

#zFleck 
You are providing security consultancy to assist a company with improving incident response procedures. The business manager wants to know why an out-of-band contact mechanism for responders is necessary. What do you say?
- The response team needs a secure channel to communicate over without alerting the threat actor. There may also be availability issues with the main communication network, if it has been affected by the incident.


You are consulting with a medium-size company about endpoint security solutions. What advantages does a cloud-based analytics platform have over an on-premises solution that relies on signature updates?
- Advanced persistent threat (APT) malware can use many techniques to evade signature-based detection. A cloud analytics platform, backed by machine learning, can apply more effective behavioral-based monitoring and alerting.

You are assisting a customer with implementing data loss prevention (DLP) software. Of the two products left in consideration, one supports steganalysis of image data, but the other does not. What is the risk of omitting this capability?
- A threat actor could conceal information within an image file and use that to bypass the DLP system. One thing to note is that attackers could find other ways to implement covertexts (audio or video, for instance) or abuse protocol coding. There are many things that steganalysis needs to be able to scan for! You might also note that steganography is not only a data exfiltration risk. It can also be used to smuggle malicious code into a host system.
