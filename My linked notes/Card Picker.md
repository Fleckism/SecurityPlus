- A basic principle of security stating that unless something has explicitly been granted access, it should be denied access.

What is the significance of the fact that digital evidence is latent?

- The evidence cannot be seen directly but must be interpreted so the validity of the interpreting process must be unquestionable.

service account

- A host or network account that is designed to run a background service, rather than to log on interactively.

authenticator

- A PNAC switch or router that activates EAPoL and passes a supplicant's authentication data to an authenticating server, such as a RADIUS server.

XSRF (cross-site request forgery)

- A malicious script hosted on the attacker's site that can exploit a session started on another site in the same browser. Also referred to as client-side request forgery (CSRF).

Kerberos

- A single sign-on authentication and authorization service that is based on a time-sensitive ticket-granting system.

pointer dereferencing

- A software vulnerability that can occur when code attempts to read a memory location specified by a pointer, but the memory location is null.

packet sniffing

- Recording data from frames as they pass over network media, using methods such as a mirror port or tap device.

True or false? The "first responder" is whoever first reports an incident to the CIRT.

- False—the first responder would be the member of the CIRT to handle the report.

packet trace analysis

- The act of examining data packet communications to reveal insights without digging into packet content, such as when the packet contents are encrypted. Clues derived from packet trace analysis might help an intruder, but they are also quite useful for defensive monitoring and security intelligence analysis. Also referred to as traffic flow analysis.

IoT (Internet of Things)

- Devices that can report state and configuration data and be remotely managed over IP networks.

You have been asked to investigate a web server for possible intrusion. You identify a script with the following code. What language is the code in and does it seem likely to be malicious? import os, sockets, syslog def r_conn(ip) s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM) s.connect(("logging.trusted.foo",514)) ...

- The code is written in Python. It uses various modules with default library code to interact with the OS and network, and also the syslog logging platform. The first lines of code define a function to connect to a host over port 514 (syslog). SOCK_DGRAM is a UDP connection, which is standard for syslog. Most likely the script is for remote logging and unlikely to be malicious, especially if trusted.foo is a known domain.

	- import is lower case
