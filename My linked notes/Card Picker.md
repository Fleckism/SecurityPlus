You are investigating a client workstation that has not obtained updates to its endpoint protection software for days. On the workstation you discover thousands of executable files with random names. The local endpoint log reveals that all of them have been scanned and identified as malware. You can find no evidence of any further intrusion on the network. What is the likely motive of the threat actor?

- This could be an offline tainted data attack against the endpoint software's identification engine.

MitB attack (Man-in-the-Browser attack)
- An attack when the web browser is compromised by installing malicious plug-ins or scripts, or intercepting API calls between the browser process and DLLs.

vulnerability feed
- A synchronizable list of data and scripts used to check for vulnerabilities. Also referred to as plug-ins or network vulnerability tests (NVTs).

blockchain
- A concept in which an expanding list of transactional records listed in a public ledger is secured using cryptography.

What countermeasures can you use against the threat of malicious firmware code?
- Only use reputable suppliers for peripheral devices and strictly controlled sources for firmware updates. Consider use of a sheep dip sandboxed system to observe a device before allowing it to be attached to a host in the enterprise network. Use execution control software to allow only approved USB vendors.

white team
- Staff administering, evaluating, and supervising a penetration test or incident response exercise.

active defense
- The practice of responding to a threat by destroying or deceiving a threat actor's capabilities.

password cracking
- Password guessing software can attempt to crack captured hashes of user credentials by running through all possible combinations (brute force). This can be made less computationally intensive by using a dictionary of standard words or phrases.

When using S/MIME, which key is used to encrypt a message?
- The recipient's public key (principally). The public key is used to encrypt a symmetric session key and (for performance reasons) the session key does the actual data encoding. The session key and, therefore, the message text can then only be recovered by the recipient, who uses the linked private key to decrypt it.


True or false? A virtual IP is a means by which two appliances can be put in a fault tolerant configuration to respond to requests for the same IP address?
- True

Which security property is assured by symmetric encryption?
- Confidentialityâ€”symmetric ciphers are generally fast and well suited to bulk encrypting large amounts of data.

NAT (network address translation)
- A routing mechanism that conceals internal addressing schemes from the public Internet by translating between a single public address on the external side of a router and private, non-routable addresses internally.

extranet
- A private network that provides some access to outside parties, particularly vendors, partners, and select customers.

CE (cryptographic erase)
- A method of sanitizing a self-encrypting drive by erasing the media encryption key.

What areas of a business or workflow must you examine to assess multiparty risk?
- You need to examine supply chain dependencies to identify how problems with one or more suppliers would impact your business. You also need to examine customer relationships to determine what liabilities you have in the event of an incident impacting your ability to supply a product or service and what impact disruption of important customer accounts would have, should cyber incidents disrupt their business.

public key
- During asymmetric encryption, this key is freely distributed and can be used to perform the reverse encryption or decryption operation of the linked private key in the pair.

USB data blocker (Universal Serial Bus data blocker)
- Hardware plug to prevent malicious data transfer when a device is plugged into a USB charging point.

zero trust
- Security design paradigm where any request (host-to-host or container-to-container) must be authenticated before being allowed.

STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression)
- A framework for analyzing cybersecurity incidents.

MMS (multimedia messaging service)
- Extension to SMS allowing digital data (picture, video, or audio) to be sent over a cellular data connection.


CSR (certificate signing request)
- A Base64 ASCII file that a subject sends to a CA to get a certificate.

CBT (computer-based training)
- Training and education programs delivered using computer devices and e-learning instructional models and design.

FTPS
- A type of FTP using TLS for confidentiality.

#zFleck stream cipher
- A type of symmetric encryption that combines a stream of plaintext bits or bytes with a pseudorandom stream initialized by a secret key.
