**Fake**

**(1)** Faking the sending address of a transmission in order to gain illegal entry into a secure system. See [email spoofing](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/email-spoofing) and [how to spoof your techie friends](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/how-to-spoof-your-techie-friends).

**(2)** Creating fake responses or signals in order to keep a session active and prevent timeouts. For example, mainframes continuously poll their terminals. If the lines to remote terminals are temporarily suspended because there is no traffic, a local device spoofs the host with "I'm still here" responses.
