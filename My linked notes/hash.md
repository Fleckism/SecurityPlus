A cryptographic hashing [[algorithm]] produces a fixed length string from an input plaintext that can be of any length.

The output can be referred to as a 
- checksum, 
- message [[digest]], or 
- hash = digest

There are two popular implementations [[hash]] algorithms:

-   Secure Hash Algorithm ([[SHA]])—considered the strongest algorithm. There are variants that produce different-sized outputs, with longer digests considered more secure. The most popular variant is SHA-256, which produces a 256-bit digest.
-   Message Digest Algorithm #5 ([[MD5]])—produces a 128-bit digest. MD5 is not considered to be quite as safe for use as SHA-256, but it might be required for compatibility between security products.

Passwords stored as hashes are vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks. A password hash cannot be decrypted; [[hash]] functions are one-way
