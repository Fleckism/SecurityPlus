application vulnerability is a design flaw that can cause the security system to be circumvented or that will cause the application to crash
#GRC
Operating system (OS)—an application exploit will run with the permissions of the logged on user, which will hopefully be limited. A vulnerability in an OS kernel file or shared library is more likely to allow   **privilege escalation**, where the malware code runs with higher access rights (system or root). Dirty COW is one example of a Linux kernel vulnerability ([access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141)).

 Firmware—[[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] can exist in the BIOS/UEFI firmware that controls the boot process for PCs. There can also be bugs in device firmware, such as network cards and disk controllers. Finally, network appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices run OS code as a type of firmware. Like kernel [[vulnerability|vulnerabilities]], firmware exploits can be difficult to identify, because the exploit code can run with the highest level of privilege. The Intel AMT vulnerability illustrates the impacts of a firmware vulnerability ([blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf](https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/courses/5731/supplementary/us-17-Evdokimov-Intel-AMT-Stealth-Breakthrough-wp.pdf)).

A vulnerability that is exploited before the developer knows about it or can release a patch is called a zero-day
