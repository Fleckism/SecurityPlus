# CONTROL FUNCTIONAL TYPES

Security controls can also be classified in types according to the **goal** or **function** they perform:
- [[Preventive]]
- [[Detective]] 
- [[Corrective]] 

While most controls can be classed functionally as preventative, detective, or corrective, a few other types can be used to define other cases:

- [[Physical]]
- [[Deterrent]]
- [[Compensating]]
