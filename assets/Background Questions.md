- Do the ports match up to there protocols
- anomalous
- supports many other data transfer protocols, including FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, SMB, and SMTP 
- frame data
- TCP and UDP are used to investigate network traffic

#IoA/C   IoA:  Indicator of an attack that is currently happening.
				IoC:  are “pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network.” Indicators of compromise aid information security and IT professionals in detecting data breaches, malware infections, or other threat activity. By monitoring for indicators of compromise, organizations can detect attacks and act quickly to prevent breaches from occurring or limit damages by stopping attacks in earlier stages.
				
				There are several indicators of compromise that organizations should monitor. In an [article for DarkReading](http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/top-15-indicators-of-compromise/d/d-id/1140647?), Ericka Chickowski highlights 15 key indicators of compromise:

-   Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
-   Anomalies in Privileged User Account Activity
-   Geographical Irregularities
-   Log-In Red Flags
-   Increases in Database Read Volume
-   HTML Response Sizes
-   Large Numbers of Requests for the Same File
-   Mismatched Port-Application Traffic
-   Suspicious Registry or System File Changes
-   Unusual DNS Requests
-   Unexpected Patching of Systems
-   Mobile Device Profile Changes
-   Bundles of Data in the Wrong Place
-   Web Traffic with Unhuman Behavior
-   Signs of DDoS Activity
