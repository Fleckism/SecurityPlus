# What is?
- client/server model
- a primary control
- a compensating control
- high latency
- TCP handshake
- UDP 
- Do the ports match up to there protocols
- anomalous
- supports many other data transfer protocols, including FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, SMB, and SMTP 
- frame data
- TCP and UDP are used to investigate network traffic
