attack vectors
Threat types:   viruses or rootkits, Trojans, botnets, and specific software vulnerabilities

Capability:  Script kiddie using a commodity attack tool that are widely available on the web or dark web.  More capable threat actors take advantage of zero-day exploits.

Hacker: describes an individual who has the skills to gain access to computer systems through unauthorized or unapproved mean

A script kiddie is someone who uses hacker tools without necessarily understanding how they work or having the ability to craft new attack

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) APT refers to the ongoing ability of an adversary to compromise network security—to obtain and maintain access—using a variety of tools and techniques.

 shadow IT, where users purchase or introduce computer hardware or software to the workplace without the sanction of the IT department and without going through a procurement and security analysis process.
 
  attack vector is the path that a threat actor uses to gain access to a secure system
  
  access means being able to run malicious code on the target.
  
  deep web is any part of the World Wide Web that is not indexed by a search engine
  
  A tactic, technique, or procedure (TTP) is a generalized statement of adversary behavior. 2A
  	- TTPs describe what and how an adversary acts and Indicators describe how to recognize what those actions might look like.
  
  As a military term, Army [doctrine](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1_02.pdf) is defined as the fundamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. 2A
  
  indicator of compromise (IoC) is a residual sign that an asset or network has been successfully attacked or is continuing to be attacked. Put another way, an IoC is evidence of a TTP.

-   ipconfig—show the configuration assigned to network interface(s) in Windows, including the hardware or media access control (MAC) address, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, default gateway, and whether the address is static or assigned by DHCP. If the address is DHCP-assigned, the output also shows the address of the DHCP server that provided the lease.
-   ifconfig—show the configuration assigned to network interface(s) in Linux.
-   ping—probe a host on a particular IP address or host name using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). You can use ping with a simple script to perform a sweep of all the IP addresses in a subnet. The following example will scan the 10.1.0.0/24 subnet from a Windows machine:
