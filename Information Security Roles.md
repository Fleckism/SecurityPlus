- Jr. security analyst

# Information Security (infosec)
## CIA Triad (aka AIC):  Secure information processing system
- Confidentiality: Information should only be know to certain people.
- Integrity:  Means the data is stored and transferred as intended and modifications are only done by authorized users.
- Availability:  Means the information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it.
- Non-repudiation: An act cannot be denied by a person.

# Cybersecurity Framework
-   Identify—develop security policies and capabilities. Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate them.
-   Protect—procure/develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software assets with security as an embedded requirement of every stage of this operations life cycle.
-   Detect—perform ongoing, proactive monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of protecting against new types of threats.
-   Respond—identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats to systems and data security.
-   Recover—implement cybersecurity resilience to restore systems and data if other controls are unable to prevent attacks.

## Incident Response
- cyber incident response team (CIRT)/
- computer security incident response team (CSIRT)/
- computer emergency response team (CERT)

# Security Control Categories
A security control is something designed to give a system or data asset the properties of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation. Controls can be divided into three broad categories, representing the way the control is implemented:

-   Technical—the control is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware). For example, firewalls, antivirus software, and OS access control models are technical controls. Technical controls may also be described as logical controls.
-   Operational—the control is implemented primarily by people rather than systems. For example, security guards and training programs are operational controls rather than technical controls.
-   Managerial—the control gives oversight of the information system. Examples could include risk identification or a tool allowing the evaluation and selection of other security controls.

# Security Control functional types
- Preventive:
