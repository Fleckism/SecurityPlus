One of the most prevalent threats to computers today is malicious code. As a security professional, you will likely have experience in dealing with unwanted software infecting your systems. By classifying the various types of malware and identifying the signs of infection, you will be better prepared to remediate compromised systems or prevent malware from executing in the first place.

# MALWARE CLASSIFICATION 

Many of the intrusion attempts perpetrated against computer networks depend on the use of malicious software, or [[malware]]. _Malware_ is usually simply defined as software that does something bad, from the perspective of the system owner. There are many types of malware, but they are not classified in a rigorous way, so some definitions overlap or are blurred. Some malware classifications, such as Trojan, virus, and worm, focus on the [[vector]] used by the malware. The **vector is the method by which the malware executes on a computer and potentially spreads to other network hosts**. Another complicating factor with malware classification is the degree to which its installation is expected or tolerated by the user. The following categories describe some types of malware according to vector:

-   **Viruses and worms**—these represent some of the first types of malware and spread without any authorization from the user by being concealed within the executable code of another process.
-   **Trojan**—malware concealed within an installer package for software that appears to be legitimate. This type of malware does not seek any type of consent for installation and is actively designed to operate secretly.
-   **Potentially unwanted programs** ([[PUPs]])/**Potentially unwanted applications** ([[PUAs]])—software installed alongside a package selected by the user or perhaps bundled with a new computer system. Unlike a Trojan, the presence of a PUP is not automatically regarded as malicious. It may have been installed without active consent or consent from a purposefully confusing license agreement. This type of software is sometimes described as **grayware** rather than malware.

Other classifications are based on the payload delivered by the malware. The [[payload]] is an action performed by the malware other than simply replicating or persisting on a host. Examples of payload classifications include spyware, rootkit, remote access Trojan (RAT), and ransomware.

# COMPUTER VIRUSES 

A [[computer virus]] is a type of malware designed to replicate and spread from computer to computer, usually by "infecting" executable applications or program code. There are several different types of viruses and they are generally classified by the different types of file or media that they infect:

-   **Non-resident/file infector**—the virus is contained within a host executable file and runs with the host process. The virus will try to infect other process images on persistent storage and perform other payload actions. It then passes control back to the host program.
-   **Memory resident**—when the host file is executed, the virus creates a new process for itself in memory. The malicious process remains in memory, even if the host process is terminated.
-   **Boot**—the virus code is written to the disk boot sector or the partition table of a fixed disk or USB media, and executes as a memory resident process when the OS starts or the media is attached to the computer.
-   **Script and macro viruses**—the malware uses the programming features available in local scripting engines for the OS and/or browser, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), JavaScript, Microsoft Office documents with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code enabled, or PDF documents with JavaScript enabled.

In addition, the term **multipartite** is used for viruses that use multiple vectors and **polymorphic** for viruses that can dynamically change or obfuscate their code to evade detection.

What these types of viruses have in common is that they must infect a host file or media. An infected file can be distributed through any normal means—on a disk, on a network, as an attachment to an email or social media post, or as a download from a website.

# COMPUTER WORMS AND FILELESS MALWARE

A computer worm is memory-resident [malware] that can run without user intervention and replicate over network resources. A virus is executed only when the user performs an action such as downloading and running an infected executable process, attaching an infected USB stick, or opening an infected Word document with macros enabled. By contrast, a [[worm]] can execute by exploiting a vulnerability in a process when the user browses a website, runs a vulnerable server application, or is connected to an infected file share. For example, the Code-Red worm was able to infect early versions of Microsoft's IIS web server software via a buffer overflow vulnerability. It then scanned randomly generated IP ranges to try to infect other vulnerable IIS servers ([caida.org/research/security/code-red](https://www.caida.org/research/security/code-red/)).

The primary effect of the first types of computer worm is to rapidly consume network bandwidth as the worm replicates. A worm may also be able to crash an operating system or server application (performing a Denial of Service attack[[DoS]]). Also, like viruses, worms can carry a payload that may perform some other malicious action. 

The Conficker worm illustrated the potential for remote code execution and memory-resident malware to effect highly potent attacks ([secureworks.com/research/downadup-removal](https://www.secureworks.com/research/downadup-removal)). As malware continues to be developed for criminal intent and security software becomes more able to detect and block static threats, malware code and techniques have become more sophisticated. The term _fileless_ has gained prominence to refer to these modern types of malware. [[Fileless]] is not a definitive classification, but it describes a collection of common behaviors and techniques:

-   Fileless [[malware]] does not write its code to disk. The malware uses memory resident techniques to run in its own process, within a host process or dynamic link library ([[DLL]]), or within a scripting host. This does not mean that there is no disk activity at all, however. The malware may change registry values to achieve persistence (executing if the host computer is restarted). The initial execution of the malware may also depend on the user running a downloaded script, file attachment, or Trojan software package.
-   Fileless malware uses lightweight shellcode to achieve a backdoor mechanism on the host. The shellcode is easy to recompile in an obfuscated form to evade detection by scanners. It is then able to download additional packages or payloads to achieve the actor's actions and/or objectives. These packages can also be obfuscated, streamed, and compiled on the fly to evade automated detection.
-   Fileless malware may use "live off the land" techniques rather than compiled executables to evade detection. This means that the malware code uses legitimate system scripting tools, notably PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), to execute payload actions. If they can be executed with sufficient permissions, these environments provide all the tools the attacker needs to perform scanning, reconfigure settings, and exfiltrate data.

The terms _advanced persistent threat ([[APT]])_ and _advanced volatile threat (AVT)_ can be used to describe this general class of modern fileless/live off the land malware. Another useful classification is low observable characteristics ([[LOC]]) attack ([mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/ransomware/what-is-fileless-malware.html](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/ransomware/what-is-fileless-malware.html)). The exact classification is less important than the realization that adversaries can use any variety of coding tricks to effect intrusions and that their tactics, techniques, and procedures to evade detection are continually evolving.

# SPYWARE AND KEYLOGGERS

The first viruses and worms focused on the destructive potential of being able to replicate. As the profitable uses of this software became apparent, however, they started to be coded with payloads designed to facilitate intrusion, fraud, and data theft. Various types of unwanted code and malware perform some level of monitoring:

-   Tracking cookies—cookies are plaintext files, not malware, but if browser settings allow third-party cookies, they can be used to record pages visited, search queries, browser metadata, and IP address. Tracking cookies are created by adverts and analytics widgets embedded into many websites.
-   Adware—this is a class of PUP/grayware that performs browser reconfigurations, such as allowing tracking cookies, changing default search providers, opening sponsor's pages at startup, adding bookmarks, and so on. Adware may be installed as a program or as a browser extension/plug-in.
-   Spyware—this is malware that can perform adware-like tracking, but also monitor local application activity, take screenshots, and activate recording devices, such as a microphone or webcam. Another spyware technique is to perform DNS redirection to pharming sites.
-   A keylogger is spyware that actively attempts to steal confidential information by recording keystrokes. The attacker will usually hope to discover passwords or credit card data.

Actual Keylogger is a Windows-based software that can run in the background to monitor different kinds of computer activity (opening and closing programs, browsing websites, recording keystrokes, and capturing screenshots).

Keyloggers are not only implemented as software. A malicious script can transmit key presses to a third-party website. There are also hardware devices to capture key presses to a modified USB adapter inserted between the keyboard and the port. Such devices can store data locally or come with Wi-Fi connectivity to send data to a covert access point. Other attacks include wireless sniffers to record key press data, overlay ATM pin pads, and so on.
